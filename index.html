But in the past fifty years it has experienced a remarkable recovery and rebirth. In this important book, leading environmental historian Nancy Langston offers a rich portrait of the lake&#x2019;s environmental and social history, asking what lessons we should take from the conservation recovery as this extraordinary lake faces new environmental threats.<br> &nbsp;<br> In her insightful exploration, Langston reveals hope in ecosystem resilience and the power of community advocacy, noting ways Lake Superior has rebounded from the effects of deforestation and toxic waste wrought by mining and paper manufacturing. Yet, despite the lake&#x2019;s resilience, threats persist. Langston cautions readers regarding new mining interests and persistent toxic pollutants that are mobilizing with climate change.</p><p>Lake Superior has had a remarkable history, including resource extraction and industrial exploitation that caused nearly irreversible degradation, followed by an environmental rebirth in the past fifty years. But climate change, pollutants, and invasive species pose new risks. In this powerful book, a leading historian richly portrays the lake&#x2019;s environmental and social history and asks what lessons we should take from the lake&#x2019;s history to sustain its future.<b>Nancy Langston</b> is professor of environmental history at Michigan Technological University and the author of <i>Toxic Bodies: Hormone Disruptors and the Legacy of DES. </i>She lives on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Lake Superior.</p><h2>Oral History and Public Memories (Critical Perspectives On The P)</h2><p>What distinguishes these essays from much work in oral history is their focus not on the experience of individual narrators, but on the broader cultural meanings of oral history narratives. And what distinguishes them from other work in memory studies is their grounding in real events.</p><p>Paula Hamilton is Associate Professor in History at the University of Technology in Sydney, Australia.

Owen is a tabby with a catnip addiction and Hercules is a stocky tuxedo cat who shares Kathleen&#39;s fondness for Barry Manilow. But beyond all the fur and purrs, there&#39;s something more to these felines. When murder interrupts Mayville&#39;s Music Festival, Kathleen finds herself the prime suspect. More stunning is her realization that Owen and Hercules are magical-and she&#39;s relying on their skills to solve a purr-fect murder.</p><p><b>Sofie Kelly</b> is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and mixed-media artist who lives on the East Coast with her husband and daughter.

Her books, like the million-plus copy <i>A Whole New Light</i>, fly off the shelves in bookstores of every size and style. <i>Heaven's Price</i> follows on the heels of national hardcover best-sellers <i>Adam's Fall</i>, <i>Silken Web</i>, <i>Fanta C</i>, <i>Where There's Smoke</i>, <i>French Silk</i>, and <i>Texas! Sage</i>. <p>In <i>Heaven's Price</i> she has written a deliciously sensual novel of a woman torn between her career and her heart. Blair Simpson thought she had it all -- a satisfying career as a dancer, a great Manhattan apartment and no emotional entanglements. But when Blair injures her knees dancing she is forced to put her life on hold and move to Long Island to recuperate. Blair has never met anyone like her new landlord Sean, who questions her methods and her lifestyle at every turn. Yet Blair is determined to continue dancing, even if it means risking her health. What she can't see, until it's much too late, is that while she's healing her body, she's losing her heart... as Sean makes her question her most intimate beliefs--about men, about love, and mostly, about herself. Now, as professional duty and her passionate yearnings clash, she must choose the right course for them both.

But at the same time, Catholic missionaries were sent into the European countryside, and there they encountered nominal Catholics who seemed as ignorant of core Catholic beliefs as any of the heathens in far-off lands. The situation seemed especially bad in southern Italy, and it became commonplace for Counter Reformation missionaries to call this area of Europe 'our Italian Indies.'"&#x2015; <i>from the Introduction</i></p><p>In his acclaimed <i>Madonnas that Maim</i>, Michael Carroll began his systematic examination of popular Catholicism in Italy.

The stories blend into one masterly and moving whole: poignant, compassionate, and profound in emotional impact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this fourth book of the five-volume Manawaka series, Vanessa MacLeod takes her rightful place alongside the other unforgettable heroines of Manawaka: Hagar Shipley in&nbsp;<i>The Stone Angel</i>, Rachel Cameron in&nbsp;<i>A Jest of God</i>, Stacey MacAindra in<i>The Fire-Dwellers</i>, and Morag Gunn in&nbsp;<i>The Diviners</i>.</p><p>Margaret Laurence was born in Neepawa, Manitoba, in 1926. Upon graduation from Winnipeg's United College in 1947, she took a job as a reporter for the <i>Winnipeg Citizen</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1950 until 1957 Laurence lived in Africa, the first two years in Somalia, the next five in Ghana, where her husband, a civil engineer, was working. She translated Somali poetry and prose during this time, and began her career as a fiction writer with stories set in Africa. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Laurence returned to Canada in 1957, she settled in Vancouver, where she devoted herself to fiction with a Ghanaian setting: in her first novel, <i>This Side Jordan</i>, and in her first collection of short fiction, T<i>he Tomorrow-Tamer</i>. Her two years in Somalia were the subject of her memoir, <i>The Prophet's Camel Bell</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separating from her husband in 1962, Laurence moved to England, which became her home for a decade, the time she devoted to the creation of five books about the fictional town of Manawaka, patterned after her birthplace, and its people: <i>The Stone Angel</i>, <i>A Jest of God</i>, <i>The Fire-Dwellers</i>, <i>A Bird in the House</i>, and <i>The Diviners</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laurence settled in Lakefield, Ontario, in 1974. She complemented her fiction with essays, book reviews, and four children's books. Her many honours include two Governor General's Awards for Fiction and more than a dozen honorary degrees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret Laurence died in Lakefield, Ontario in 1987.<b>The Sound of the Singing</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That house in Manawaka is the one which, more than any other, I carry with me. Known to the rest of the town as &#x201c;the old Connor place&#x201d; and to the family as the Brick House, it was plain as the winter turnips in its root cellar, sparsely windowed as some crusader&#x2019;s embattled fortress in a heathen wilderness, its rooms in a perpetual gloom except in the brief height of summer. Many other brick structures had existed in Manawaka for as much as half a century, but at the time when my grandfather built his house, part dwelling place and part massive-monument, it had been the first of its kind.<br>&nbsp;<br>Set back at a decent distance from the street, it was screened by a line of spruce trees whose green-black branches swept down to the earth like the sternly protective wings of giant hawks. Spruce was not indigenous to that part of the prairies. Timothy Connor had brought the seedlings all the way from Galloping Mountain, a hundred miles north, not on whim, one may be sure, but feeling that they were the trees for him. By the mid-thirties, the spruces were taller than the house, and two generations of children had clutched at boughs which were as rough and hornily knuckled as the hands of old farmers, and had swung themselves up to secret sanctuaries. On thelawn a few wild blue violets dared to grow, despite frequent beheadings from the clanking guillotine lawn mower, and mauve-flowered Creeping Charley insinuated deceptively weak-looking tendrils up to the very edges of the flower beds where helmeted snapdragon stood in precision.<br>&nbsp;<br>We always went for Sunday dinner to the Brick House, the home of my mother&#x2019;s parents. This particular day my father had been called out to South Wachakwa, where someone had pneumonia, so only my mother and myself were flying down the sidewalk, hurrying to get there. My mother walked with short urgent steps, and I had to run to keep up, which I did not like having to do, for I was ten that spring and needed my dignity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dad said you shouldn&#x2019;t walk so fast because of the baby. I heard him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My father was a doctor, and like many doctors, his advice to his own family was of an exceedingly casual nature. My mother&#x2019;s prenatal care, apart from &#x201c;For Pete&#x2019;s sake, honey, quit running around like a chicken with its head cut off,&#x201d; consisted mainly of admonitions to breathe deeply and drink plenty of water.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mercy,&#x201d; my mother replied, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to slow up that much, I should hope. Get a move on, Vanessa. It&#x2019;s nearly five, and we should&#x2019;ve been there by now. I suppose Edna will have the dinner all ready, and there won&#x2019;t be a thing for me to do. I wish to heaven she wouldn&#x2019;t, but try to tell her. Anyway, you know how your grandfather hates people to be late.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When we got to the Brick House, my mother stopped hurrying, knowing that Grandfather would be watching from the bay window. She tidied my hair, which was fine and straight and tended to get in my eyes, and she smoothed down the collar of the white middy which I hated and resented having to wear today with my navy pleated skirt as though it had still been winter.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Your summer dresses are all up to your neck,&#x201d; my mother had said, &#x201c;and we just can&#x2019;t manage a new one this year, but I&#x2019;m certainly not going to have you going down there looking like a hooligan.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now that the pace of our walking had slowed, I began to hop along the sidewalk trying to touch the crooked lines where the cement had been frost-heaved, some winter or other, and never repaired. The ants made their homes there, and on each fissure a neat mound of earth appeared. I carefully tamped one down with my foot, until the ant castle was flattened to nothing. Then I hopped on, chanting.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Step on a crack, break your grandfather&#x2019;s back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not very nice, Vanessa,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;Anyway, I always thought it was your mother&#x2019;s back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; I said accusingly, hurt that she could imagine the substitution to have been accidental, for I had genuinely thought it would please her.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Try not to tear up and down stairs like you did last week,&#x201d; my mother said anxiously. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too old for that kind of shenanigans.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grandfather was standing on the front porch to greet us. He was a tall husky man, drum-chested, and once he had possessed great muscular strength. That simple power was gone now, but age had not stooped him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, Beth, you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; Grandfather said. &#x201c;Past five, ain&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only ten to,&#x201d; my mother said defensively. &#x201c;I hoped Ewen might be back &#x2013; that&#x2019;s why I waited. He had to go to South Wachakwa on a call.&#x201d;<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think a man could stay home on a Sunday,&#x201d; Grandfather said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Good grief, Father,&#x201d; my mother said, &#x201c;people get sick on Sundays the same as any other day.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But she said it under her breath, so he did not hear her.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, come in, come in,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No use standing around here all day. Go and say hello to your grandmother, Vanessa.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ample and waistless in her brown silk dress, Grand mother was sitting in the dining room watching the canary. The bird had no name. She did not believe in bestowing names upon non-humans, for a name to her meant a christening, possible only for Christians. She called the canary &#x201c;Birdie,&#x201d; and maintained that this was not like a real name. It was swaying lightly on the bird-swing in its cage, its attentive eyes fixed upon her. She often sat here, quietly and apparently at ease, not feeling it necessary to be talking or doing, beside the window sill with its row of African violets in old ginger jars that had been painted orange. She would try to coax the canary into its crystal trilling, but it was a surly creature and obliged only occasionally. She liked me to sit here with her, and sometimes I did, but I soon grew impatient and began squirming, until Grandmother would smile and say, &#x201c;All right, pet, you run along, now,&#x201d; and then I would be off like buckshot. When I asked my grandmother if the bird minded being there, she shook her head and said no, it had been there always and wouldn&#x2019;t know what to do with itself outside, and I thought this must surely be so, for it was a family saying that she couldn&#x2019;t tell a lie if her life depended on it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hello, pet,&#x201d; Grandmother said. &#x201c;Did you go to Sunday school?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What did you learn?&#x201d; Grandmother asked, not prying or demanding, but confidently, serenely.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was prepared, for the question was the same each week. I rarely listened in Sunday school, finding it more entertaining to compose in my head stories of spectacular heroism in which I figured as central character, so I never knew what the text had been. But I had read large portions of the Bible by myself, for I was constantly hard-up for reading material, so I had no trouble in providing myself with a verse each week before setting out for the Brick House. My lines were generally of a warlike nature, for I did not favour the meek stories and I had no use at all for the begats.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&#x201c;How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle</i>,&#x201d; I replied instantly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Second Samuel,&#x201d; Grandmother said, nodding her head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very nice, dear.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was not astonished that my grandmother thought the bloody death of Jonathan was very nice, for this was her unvarying response, whatever the verse. And in fact it was not strange, for to her everything in the Bible was as gentle as she herself. The swords were spiritual only, strokes of lightness and dark, and the wounds poured cochineal.<br>&nbsp;<br>Grandfather tramped into the dining room. His hair was yellowish white, but once it had been as black as my own, and his brown beaked leathery face was still handsome.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d best come into the living room, Agnes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No use waiting here. Beth says Ewen&#x2019;s gone away out to South Wachakwa. It&#x2019;ll be a wonder if we get our dinner at all tonight.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grandmother rose. &#x201c;Yes, I was just coming in.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grandfather walked over to the window and peered at the plants on the sill.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Them jars could do with a coat of paint,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got some enamel left in the basement. It&#x2019;s that bottle-green I used on the tool-shed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Is there no orange left?&#x201d; Grandmother enquired.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s all used up. What&#x2019;s the matter with bottle-green?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, nothing&#x2019;s the matter with it, I guess. I just wondered, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do them first thing tomorrow, then,&#x201d; Grandfather said decisively.<br>&nbsp;<br>No tasks could be undertaken today, but there was no rule against making plans for Monday, so my grandfather invariably spent the Sabbath in this manner. Thwarted, but making the best of a bad lot, he lumbered around the house like some great &nbsp;wakeful bear waiting for the enforced hibernation of Sunday to be over. He stopped at the hall door now and rattled it, running hard expert fingers along the brass hinges.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hinge is loose,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The pin&#x2019;s worn. I&#x2019;ll have to go down to the store and see if they&#x2019;ve got one. That Barnes probably won&#x2019;t have the right size &#x2013; he&#x2019;s got no notion of stock. Maybe I&#x2019;ve got an extra one in the basement. Yes, I have an idea there&#x2019;s one there. I&#x2019;ll just step down and have a look.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I heard him clumping down the basement steps, and soon from the area of his work-bench there arose the soft metallic jangle of nails and bolts, collected oddments being sifted through. I glanced at my grandmother, but if she was relieved that he was rummaging down there, she gave no sign.<br>&nbsp;<br>I did not know then the real torment that the day of rest was for him, so I had no patience with his impatience. WhatI did know, however, was that if he had been any other way he would not have passed muster in Manawaka. He was widely acknowledged as an upright man. It would have been a disgrace if he had been known by the opposite word, which was &nbsp;&#x201c;downright.&#x201d; A few of my friends had downright grandfathers. They were a deep mortification to their families, these untidy old men who sat on the Bank of Montreal steps in the summertime and spat amber tobacco jets onto the dusty sidewalk. They were described as &#x201c;downright worthless&#x201d; or &#x201c;downright lazy,&#x201d; these two terms being synonymous. These shadows of wastrels, these flimsy remnants of past profligates, with their dry laughter like the cackle of crows or the crackling of fallen leaves underfoot, embarrassed me terribly, although I did not have any idea why. Walking down main street, I would avoid looking at them, feeling somehow that they should not be on view, that they should be hidden away in an attic along with the other relics too common to be called antiques and too broken to be of any further use. Yet I was inexplicably drawn to them, too.</p><h2>The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior (Wildlife Behavior &amp; Ecology)</h2><p><p>In this seminal study, Hans Kruuk redefines the image of the spotted hyena, not as a common scavenger, but as a complex matriarchal predator with links to human evolution. <i>The Spotted Hyena</i> is the first study to capture the true behavior and ecology of these formidable predators, who instinctively adapt their social structure to meet their ecological needs. Kruuk's research reveals for the first time that hyenas combine carnivorous habits with group territoriality, thus drawing parallels between their existence and that of wolves, lions, and arguably early humans.</p> <p>In addition to being lovable rogues, spotted hyenas are sophisticated hunters that live in complex communities of up to 80 animals. Covering more than broad facts about this species, Kruuk addresses the vital questions concerning hyena behavior such as why females are dominant, why lions scavenge from hyenas, why hyenas hunt zebra and wildebeest differently, and how their social behavior correlates with ecology.</p> <p>Since its original publication, <i>The Spotted Hyena</i> has transformed the common perception of the spotted hyena. With nearly 2,000 citations in scientific literature, <i>The Spotted Hyena</i> has become a classic work and trailblazer for linking changes in animal behavior with the environment, in addition to its concentration on a large carnivore that shares several characteristics with select primates.</p> <p>Although this is a science book, Kruuk skips the jargon and complicated theory, thus making its conclusions easily accessible to any student of natural history, African predators, or social behavior within animal communities. <i>The Spotted Hyena</i> features exciting field notes in addition to comprehensive graphs and tables that have made it an invaluable contribution to behavioral ecology and its methodology.</p> <p><b>Hans Kruuk</b> studied hyenas while living in the wilderness of Africa's Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater for many years. After completing his doctorate with Nobel Prize winner Niko Tinbergen at the University of Oxford, Kruuk was asked by the former Tanganyika (now Tanzania) National Parks to study predation in the Serengeti. Kruuk focused on the most important carnivore there&#x2014;the spotted hyena&#x2014;and co-founded the Serengeti Research Institute in Tanzania to carry out his research. Many years later in 1997, he retired emeritus from his position as Senior Principal Research Officer at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology in Banchory, Scotland.</p> <p>Kruuk has carried out research projects on mammals and birds on all continents, published seven books and over 120 scientific papers.

Over four days of rioting, mobs of violent whites killed at least 10 blacks, looted black-owned businesses, and ransacked homes and neighborhoods. In the days immediately following the riot, black and white leaders came together in an unprecedented move, setting the stage for Atlanta&#x2019;s emergence as the city too busy to hate&#x201d; decades later. But while their business-first attitude may have quelled the most overt rhetoric and raging violence, it also reinforced class prejudices that existed in both the black and white communities.<br><br>Released on the 100-year anniversary of the riots, <i>Rage in the Gate City</i> provides a compelling narrative of the events during the month that shaped Atlanta and explores questions of race and class prejudice that are as relevant today as they were a century ago.</p><p>Revealing a tragic chapter from Atlanta&#39;s pastDuring the hot summer of 1906, anger simmered in Atlanta, a city that outwardly savored its reputation as the Gate City of the New South, a place where the races lived peacefully, if apart, and everyone focused more on prosperity than prejudice. But racial hatred came to the forefront during a heated political campaign, and the city's newspapers fanned its flames with sensational reports alleging assaults on white women by black men. The rage erupted in late September, and, during one of the most brutal race riots in the history of America, roving groups of whites attacked and killed at least twenty-five blacks. After four days of violence, black and white civic leaders came together in unprecedented meetings that can be viewed either as concerted public relations efforts to downplay the events or as setting the stage for Atlanta's civil rights leadership half a century later. <p> Rage in the Gate City focuses on the events of August and September 1906, offering readers a tightly woven narrative account of those eventful days. Fast-paced and vividly detailed, it brings history to life. As June Dobbs Butts writes in her foreword, "For too long, this chapter of Atlanta's history was covered up, or was explained away. . . . Rebecca Burns casts the bright light of truth upon those events, offering a vital lesson."</p></p><h2>Life Itself: Exploring the Realm of the Living Cell</h2><p>Hidden in a nondescript red-brick building in Rockville, Maryland, is the most unusual warehouse in the world, a bank of living cells called the American Type Culture Collection. Here, at 321 degrees below zero--a temperature at which life abandons its vital dance and enters limbo, but without dying--are some 30,000 vials holding 60 billion living forms in suspended animation, including mouse kidney cells, turkey blood cells, armadillo spleen cells, and some 40 billion human cells. These cultured cells are essential to modern biological research--in fact, cells today are the most intimately studied life forms in all of science, for both practical and philosophical reasons. For one, all disease--from cancer and the common cold, to arthritis and AIDS--stems from cells gone awry. And cell research not only promises a cure for a wide variety of disease--it also holds the key to the mystery of life itself.<br> In <em>Life Itself</em>, Boyce Rensberger, science writer for <em>The Washington Post</em>, takes readers to the frontlines of cell research with some of the brightest investigators in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. Virtually all the hottest topics in biomedical research are covered here, such as how do cells and their minute components move? How do the body's cells heal wounds? What is cancer? Why do cells die? And what is the nature of life? Readers discover that--contrary to what we may have concluded from pictures in our high school textbooks--cells teem with activity and that, inside, they "are more crowded with components than the inside of a computer." We learn that scientists now know of at least ten molecular motors that move things about inside the cell--in most cells, this motion is short because the cell is tiny, but in the single-celled nerve fibers that run from the base of the spinal cord to the toes (measuring three or four feet in an adult human), molecular motors can take several days to make the trip. Rensberger describes the many fascinating kinds of cells found in the body, from "neural crest cells" (early in embryonic development, these cells crawl all over the embryo to the sites where they will pursue their fate--as nerve cells, or cartilage, or skin), to "dust cells" (nomadic cells in the lung that swallow and store indigestible particles, then migrate to the gullet where they themselves are swallowed and digested), to "natural killer cells" (millions of which roam the body looking for cancerous cells). We meet many of the scientists who have pioneered cell research, such as Rita Levi-Montalcini--an Italian who, shut out of her lab during World War II, continued to experiment in her bedroom at home, making the discovery ("nerve growth factor") for which she won the Nobel Prize--and American Leonard Hayflick, who proved that all human cells (except cancer cells) invariably die after about fifty divisions. Rensberger also provides an illuminating discussion of AIDS--revealing exactly why this virus is so difficult to defeat--and of cancer, explaining that before cancer can start, a whole series of rare events must occur, events so unlikely that it seems a wonder that anyone gets cancer at all. <br> The solutions to the most pressing challenges facing scientists today--from the efforts to conquer disease to the quest to understand life itself--will be found in the innermost workings of the cell. In <em>Life Itself</em>, Boyce Rensberger paints a colorful and fascinating portrait of modern research in this vital area, an account which will enthrall anyone interested in state-of-the-art science or the incredible workings of the human body.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Boyce Rensberger</strong> is Science Writer for <em>The Washington Post</em>, and creator of <em>The Post</em>'s acclaimed educational supplement, "Horizon: The Learning Section."<br>"Life Itself is a wonderfully readable digest of everything currently known about the mechanisms by which living cells perform their myriad tasks."--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"This book is a great education in the powers of ordinary language, poetically arranged to explain, to inspire, and to heighten curiosity in non-scientists and scientists alike."--Washington Post<br><br>"Rensberger has the two essential qualities of a first-rate science journalist: he grasps what is important, and he presents it in a clear, entertaining manner.

In 1994, Danny Rolling, a 40-year-old drifter and habitual criminal, confessed and was sentenced to death. Ryzuk (Thou Shalt Not Kill, Warner, 1990) has written the most complete account of this case to date (see also John Philpen &amp; John Donnelly's Beyond Murder, Onyx, 1994). Rolling was the product of an abusive childhood, and Ryzuk skillfully contrasts the bright promise of the murdered students with Rolling's poverty-stricken background and borderline personality. Except for too much dramatic license in pretending always to know what Rolling was thinking, Ryzuk's approach is effective, and her book will appeal to true crime readers.<br><i>Gregor A. Preston, Univ. of California Lib., Davis</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.In August 1990, five young people were killed in Gainesville, Fla., all students at the University of Florida or Santa Fe Community College. Of the four women slain, some were also raped and others mutilated. The murders were committed by Danny Rollings, a Louisiana resident who had previously been arrested for armed robbery and theft throughout the Southeast and, after receiving a death sentence in this case, admitted to a triple murder in his home state.

A strategically located and vital center, Susa absorbed diverse influences and underwent great political fluctuations during the several thousand years of its history. When French archaeologists began to excavate its site in the nineteenth century, the astonishing abundance of finds greatly expanded our understanding of the ancient Near East. The artifacts were taken to Paris through diplomatic agreement and became a centerpiece of the Louvre's great collection of Near Eastern antiquities. These works are rarely loaned, but a remarkable selection that includes many undisputed masterpieces, brought to The Metropolitan Museum of Art for exhibition, is presented in this comprehensive publication.<br>Susa was settled about 4000 B.C. and has yielded striking pottery finds from that prehistoric period. A rich production followed of objects for daily use, ritual, and luxury living, finely carved in various materials or fashioned of clay. Monumental sculpture was made in stone or bronze, and dramatic friezes were composed of brilliantly glazed bricks. Among the discoveries are tiny, intricately carved cylinder seals and splendid jewelry. Clay balls marked with symbols offer fascinating testimony to the very beginnings of writing; clay tablets from later periods bearing inscriptions in cuneiform record political history, literature, business transactions, and mathematical calculations.<br>A very important group of finds from Susa is made up of objects brought back as booty from conquests in Mesopotamia. These works, many of them the royal monuments of Akkadian and Babylonian monarchs - for instance, the great stele of Naram-Sin - are among the best known of all objects from the ancient Near East.<br>Altogether, the exhibition presents more than two hundred objects found at Susa, produced over a period of about 3500 years. They come from all periods of the site's settlement, from it earliest history to its adornment as a major city of the opulent Achaemenid Persian empire.<br>Eighteen French and American scholars have contributed essays to this volume on subjects that include the history of art in ancient Iran from prehistoric settlement through the Achaemenid period; the history of the excavations at Susa; the development of writing; seals and sealings; royal and religious structures at Susa; objects brought from Mesopotamia; brick decoration; popular art; and cuneiform texts. Recent results of ongoing research into the archaeology of Susa are discussed. Analyses of specific techniques are included as well as reports on the conservation of objects. Each work in the exhibition is illustrated and fully described, with references to relevant publications.</p><p>This comprehensive catalog documents an exhibition, held this winter at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of 195 rarely loaned Susa masterpieces from the Louvre's Near Eastern antiquities collection.

During the several thousand years of its history, Susa absorbed diverse influences and underwent great political fluctuations. Introductory chapters on Susa, Iranian art, and the 19th-century French excavations are followed by item-by-item descriptions of objects ranging from prehistoric pottery to monumental sculpture, stelae, glazed brick friezes, intricate cylinder seals, and exquisite jewelry.

Presents situations, such as the first day of school, the birth of a sibling, or a move to a new house, and identifies two emotions each event is likely to elicit.</p><p>While the intent of these two books is admirable, the execution is dreadful. In Double-Dip Feelings, the text is plodding, didactic, and stiff. The idea is to let children know that we often experience two emotions at the same time, but any self-respecting child listening to the book would have only a single-dip feeling: boredom. The illustrations show a wide range of emotions, but they simply can't rescue the text or carry the book on their own merits. In Jessica and the Wolf, the illustrations alone are enough to give good sleepers nightmares. The sappy parents (who take the time to put on bathrobes before going to see why Jessica is screaming) come up with a solution for her--waving a magic wand at the wolf and making him disappear. Not only is this an improbable solution, it completely ignores why the child is having nightmares in the first place. The trend to Donahue-ize children's "issue" books by having experts appear on the horizon to write them creates problems. Grammar and plot development aside, social workers are out of their element, children are ill served, and purchasing these books only helps the publishers. --Christine A.

Written clearly yet without too much detail, the text moves along quickly. The pictures and diagrams deserve study, as they help readers visualize such concepts as how the moon moves in relation to the earth and the sun and why it seems to change shape. Gibbons uses a spacious format to vary page layout, presenting each facet of the moon's story with a large illustration or a series of smaller ones. Her colorful pictures of people observing the moon seem all the more brilliant against backgrounds of midnight blue.

He lives in Montana with his family.</p>Grade 4-8-After discussing the chemical properties of fire, Patent challenges assumptions about it as a harmful force and shows how it is a natural and productive part of the Earth's growth cycles. The clear, unsensationalized text is both informative and lively, with general statements often followed up with examples from the natural world. A discussion of fire-fighting methods focuses mainly on smoke jumpers. A chapter is devoted to the Yellowstone fires of 1988 and their aftermath. The book ends with a balanced look at forest-fire management and examples of successes and failures of prescribed burnings. Mu?oz's vivid full-color photographs range from dazzlingly bright scenes to the more subtle beauty of fireweed thriving amid charred and fallen trees. Seymour Simon's Wildfires (Morrow, 1996) also treats fire as a vital natural force in slightly less detail and Ann Armbruster's Wildfires (Watts, 1996) covers much of the same ground as Patent in a slightly less inviting format. Joy Masoff's Fire! (Scholastic, 1998) focuses on firefighters in fascinating detail while Laurence Pringle's Fire in the Forest (Macmillan, 1994) concentrates on the fire cycle's role in ecosystems.

This novel, originally conceived and published in two parts in 1964 and &#39;68, and later issued in paperback by Ballantine in 1975, begins like a more traditional SF tale. Protagonist Rod McBan&#39;s Norstrilian peers consider him inferior because he lacks their telepathic abilities. Nearly ``culled&#39;&#39; as part of the strictly regulated society&#39;s population control, McBan uses a computer to arbitrage the galactic financial markets, enabling him, literally, to buy Earth. While the first half would merely have made an interesting novel, the second, more lyrical part displays Smith&#39;s superior writing abilities as he describes both the Underpeople (genetically designed combinations of humans and other species-and the Instrumentality (an organization for keeping humanity from becoming stagnant). The result: a novel that transcends its time. Though not a scholarly edition (the variorum is incomplete and the introduction leaves much to be desired), this composite text, ably edited by James A. Mann, is a fine companion to the author&#39;s complete short fiction, The Rediscovery of Man.</p><p>This is a volume in the NESFA&#39;s Choice series. The objective of this series is to publish the &#34;classic&#34; works of neglected sf authors, and to keep these works in print.Cordwainer Smith (1913 - 1966) Cordwainer Smith was the most famous pen name of US foreign policy adviser Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger. Born in Milwaukee in 1913, his godfather was the Chinese revolutionary and political leader, Sun Yat-sen - the result of his political activist father&#39;s close ties with leaders of the Chinese revolution. Smith held a PhD in Political Science from Johns Hopkins, served in the US military during the Second World War and acted as an adviser to President Kennedy. Although he only published one novel, Norstrilia, Smith is well regarded for his short fiction, the majority of which is set in his future history of the Instrumentality of Mankind.</p><h2>Eliot Jones, Midnight Superhero</h2><p>All the grown-ups comment that Eliot is &#34;such a quiet little thing,&#34; unaware that at night, when the clock strikes midnight, he becomes a superhero, and now he has received his most urgent mission yet, to help a group of scientists prevent a giant meteor from crashing into Earth.</p><p>Anne Cottringer was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario. On warm summer nights with her bedroom window open, she used to listen to the Falls and dream of being a writer. After her first son was born, she took a children&#39;s writing course and tired her hand at writing children&#39;s books. Since 1996 she has published several picture books as well as a book for young readers.Mild-mannered bookworm by day, international troubleshooter by night! Little Eliot, with curly red hair like his mother and large round red-framed eyeglasses, is a model child. Quiet and obedient, he reads nearly all day and regularly feeds his pet goldfish. But at night, when all are sleeping, Eliot dons his superhero garb (green cape and boots and briefs featuring a gold &#39;E&#39;) and flies all over the world solving major (and minor) problems. Among the former: He helps the Coast Guard rescue a ship from dangerous rocks, uses code-cracking skills to find the Queen&#39;s stolen jewels and launches a rocket that bursts a meteor on a collision course with Earth. He also finds time to return lost teddy bears. Cottringer&#39;s delightful fantasy is ably abetted by Smith&#39;s scruffy mixed-media illustrations, busy and bright and full of additional jokes (such as the ocean liner that sports the name &#39;The Rubber Ducky&#39; and a bemused mountain goat he buzzes by in the Himalayas). Walter Mitty-class drollery that should appeal to children and adults alike.

There are introductions to each book of the Bible. Unlike most other translations, some editions of the GNB contain line drawings of biblical events with a snippet of text. The line drawings were done by Annie Vallotton. However, Vallotton is credited with doing the drawings only in certain editions of the GNB--in others, the drawings are simply credited to "a Swiss artist". Since the focus is strongly on ease of understanding, poetry is sometimes sacrificed for clarity. This choice can be seen in the example quotation of John 3:16, which is rendered, "For God loved the world so much that ...", which is more pedestrian than the familiar "For God so loved the world". The translated phrase contains a literal, if not figurative, mistranslation: the Greek word for "so" in that passage is &#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, which means "in such a way", not "so much". Because the implication of the phrase "in such a way that he would sacrifice his only son" includes the implication of "so much" and could certainly not include the opposite "loved the world so little," the translators chose the phrase "so much" for its brevity and clarity.</p><p></p><h2>The Architecture of Delano &amp; Aldrich (Norton Book for Architects and Designers (Hardcover))</h2><p><p><strong>The firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich occupied a central place in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century, substantially shaping the architectural climate of the period.</strong></p> The grand country estates, striking townhouses and club buildings, churches, schools, and public buildings designed by William Adams Delano (1874&#x2013;1960) and Chester Holmes Aldrich (1871&#x2013;1940) are exceptional examples of architectural creativity and originality.<br><br> Illustrated with stunning color photographs taken expressly for the book and many historic photographs, plans, and drawings reproduced in rich duotone, <em>The Architecture of Delano &amp; Aldrich</em> is the first book to give an account of the architects&#x2019; backgrounds and beginnings and the scope of their practice, setting the firm&#x2019;s work within the social and architectural context of the day. It examines twenty particularly exemplary projects, showing how the architects tempered the purely functional aesthetic, inherent in a modernist approach, with the artistic aesthetic of traditional classical architecture. Early commissions of large country and city houses and clubs as well as the larger government and civic buildings of the post-Depression years, increasingly modern and stylized, reflect their underlying dedication to a classical architectural language and the great fluidity and breadth of their work. Among the featured projects are the Walters Art Gallery (Baltimore, Maryland), High Lawn (Lenox, Massachusetts), Oheka (Cold Spring Harbor, New York), the Knickerbocker and Union Clubs (New York City), Peterloon (Indian Hill, Ohio), the U.S. Post Office Department Building (Washington, D.C.), the American Government Building (Paris), Sterling Divinity School, Yale University (New Haven, Connecticut), and the New York Municipal Airport, La Guardia Field (New York City).<br><br> A catalogue raisonn�, employee roster, and list of buildings now serving as museums are also included, making <em>The Architecture of Delano &amp; Aldrich</em> the definitive source about a practice whose work forms a lasting part of the American landscape. 45 color, 150 b&amp;w illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Peter Pennoyer</strong> is the principal partner of the eponymous architecture firm that has a national practice in classical and traditional architecture.

On the twenty-fourth morning after the decampment of his wife, Patty Lareine, he awakens with a hangover, considerable sexual excitement, and, on his upper arm, a red tattoo bearing a name from the past.

What he soon learns is that the front passenger seat of his Porsche is soaked with blood and that in a secluded corner of his marijuana stash in a nearby woods rests a blonde head, severed at the throat.<br>Is Madden therefore a murderer? He has no way of knowing. As in many novels of crime, the narrative centers on violence?physical, sexual, and emotional?but these elements move in their orbits through a rich constellation of character as Madden tries to reconstruct the missing hours of a terrible evening.

Holliday was bare-chested. He slipped into his shirt, which hung loosely on his thin frame. His trousers were too large, and when he tucked the shirttail into his waistband, he had to buckle the belt to the last notch. He began knotting his tie. Tom Eckhart was a friend as well as a physician. He studied Holliday a moment. "How much weight have you lost?" "Twenty pounds," Holliday said. "Perhaps a little more." "Considerably more, I'd judge. I wish you had come to see me sooner." Holliday was wracked by a sudden, harsh cough. He swabbed phlegm from his mouth with a handkerchief. "I thought it was pleurisy," he said. "These things sometimes linger on after a hard winter." "You should have known better," Eckhart grumbled. "Dental college should have taught you the difference." "The difference in what?" "God, I wish it were someone besides me! Why didn't you go to another doctor?" Holliday stared at him. "Just tell me." Eckhart dropped his stethoscope on the desk. "You havewhat's commonly called consumption. The correct term is 'pulmonary tuberculosis.'" "You couldn't be mistaken?" "No, John, I'm not mistaken. I've seen too much of it in the last few years." A generation of Southerners had contracted the disease during the Civil War. Younger men, their condition weakened by general hardship and the shortage of proper foods, were particularly susceptible. Even now, eleven years following the end of the war, tuberculosis was still rampant throughout the South. Holliday's features were stoic. "How bad is it?" "Quite bad," Eckhart said gravely. "Your lungs are in an advanced stage of deterioration." "You're trying to sugarcoat it, Tom. Give it to me straight." "I'm afraid your condition is terminal. As you know, there is no cure." "I see." Holliday nodded, silent a moment. He was tall, with ash-blond hair and a brushy mustache, and penetrating gray-blue eyes. Yet now his look was closed and inaccessible. "How long do I have?" "A year," Eckhart told him. "Maybe longer if you relocate to a drier climate. Atlanta is no place for a man with consumption." "What would you recommend?" "Somewhere out West, perhaps Colorado or Texas. The sooner the better, John." Eckhart thought Holliday, who was barely twenty-four, had taken the news with a maturity beyond his years. Some men, particularly one with a future in dentistry, would have accepted their fate with far less equanimity. He watched as Holliday shrugged into his suit jacket. "What will you do with your dental practice?" "Take down my shingle," Holliday said simply. "Let my patients know I'm moving west. There's no scarcity of dentists." "I suppose not," Eckhart agreed. "When will you leave?" "As soon as my affairs are in order. Nothing to hold me here now." The matter-of-fact tone piqued Eckhart's curiosity. He knew Holliday was engaged to be married, and he told himself that it was none of his business. Yet, presuming on their friendship, he couldn't resist a personal question. "Will you ask Mattie to go with you?" "Would that make her a bride or a widow?" Holliday departed on that cryptic note. He stepped through the door of the office, and turned south along Piedmont Street. Somewhere inside himself, he was struck by a bitter irony. One far too difficult to accept. He had lost more than his life today. &nbsp; <br> The evening was lit by a primrose-yellow moon. Holliday sat beside Mattie on the porch swing, cloaked in the warmth of a gentle April breeze. Her arm tucked in his, she chatted on about plans for their wedding, set for June 6. He had yet to find a way to tell her. The house was on Peachtree Road, north of the city proper, in one of Atlanta's finer residential enclaves. Like the phoenix of myth, Atlanta had risen from ashes after the Civil War. Mattie's father, the Honorable George W. Holliday, was a judge on the fifth superior court. He had survived the war, and the Reconstruction Era, to attain prominence in the new South. Last year, upon graduating from the Baltimore Dental College in Maryland, Holliday had established his practice in Atlanta. The shingle outside his office read JOHN H. HOLLIDAY, D.D.S., and he was readily accepted into the professional community. But his welcome was lukewarm, and at times bordered on frosty, in the household of Judge Holliday. The situation was aggravated by the betrothal announcement of Mattie and Holliday, early in 1876. All of Atlanta, it seemed, loved a scandal. Judge Holliday was the brother of Holliday's father. Byblood they were uncle and nephew, which meant that Mattie was Holliday's first cousin. The judge and his wife strongly opposed the engagement, for everyone knew that a union of first cousins resulted in offspring that were physically, and oftentimes mentally, impaired. But their daughter was willful and defiant, unconcerned that the man she loved was her cousin. Despite their protests, she accepted Holliday's proposal of marriage. For his part, Holliday was willing to suffer the outrage and the gossip, even the stigma of cousins joined in wedlock. His deep feelings for Mattie stemmed from their childhood, when they were raised together in Lowndes County, in southern Georgia. After the war, when he'd gone off to college and her father had been appointed to the bench in Atlanta, nothing had changed to alter their lifelong bond. He chose Atlanta to establish his dental practice for no other reason than it reunited him with Mattie. She chose him to be her husband. But now, beside her in the porch swing, Holliday searched for a way to begin, a way to tell her. She was vivacious and animated, a young woman of remarkable beauty, with auburn hair and a trim figure. In the face of her spirited manner, Holliday was at a loss as to how he might break the news. Finally, when she paused for breath, he decided the simplest way was the direct way. He steeled himself to the task. "I went to see Tom Eckhart today." "Oh, good," she said briskly. "I've been worried sick with all the weight you've lost. Did he prescribe something for your pleurisy?" Holliday held her gaze. "Tom ruled out pleurisy. He diagnosed it as consumption ... tuberculosis." "What?" She suddenly looked stricken. "Oh, John, that's not possible. He must be wrong." "No, I trust his judgment. He's seen too many cases over the years to make a mistake. He was quite certain about it." "Well, what did he say? Surely there's something to be done." Holliday had already decided that the whole truth would serve no purpose. To tell her that he'd been sentenced to death would destroy her, and he couldn't bear to see her hurt. Far better to let time and distance bring about a gradual loss of hope. "I have to go away," he said gently. "A drier climate, somewhere out West. That's the only known treatment." She squared her shoulders. "Then I'll go with you. We'll be married just as quickly as possible." She smiled bravely. "We'll go west together." "Not so fast." Holliday took her hand. "There's no need to rush things. Give me time to get located out there, and try to recuperate. We'll get married when I'm better." "How long will that take? Did Tom say?" "Six months, maybe a year. Certainly no longer." "A year!" She watched him, a dark edge of dread shading her eyes. "Are you telling me everything, John? You're not just putting me off ... are you?" Holliday smiled, reassured her with a bold lie. "Give me a little time and I'll be as good as new." He squeezed her hand. "You want a healthy husband, don't you?" "I want you, John Holliday. Healthy or not, only you." "You have me, Mattie, and that's the gospel truth. I've been yours since the day we met. Nothing will change that." Her eyes welled with tears. "You promise?" Holliday enfolded her in his arms. "Yes, I do, most solemnly. On my oath." There was no lie in the promise, and he felt absolved in that. For he would love her until the day he died. However long, or short, his time. All his life. &nbsp; <br> The following afternoon Holliday stepped off the train in Valdosta. The town was the county seat of Lowndes County, his hometown. The place of his boyhood and his rite of passage into manhood. He was there to see his father. For the most part, his memories of Valdosta were pleasant ones. Walking toward the town square, he was reminded of a time, long ago, when he'd fallen for Mattie. His family,and hers, were the landed aristocracy of Lowndes County before the Civil War. Their lives were idyllic, filled with the romanticism of youth, days of splendor. A time of innocence. Then, with the war's end, the society to which he'd been born was destroyed. The Yankees came, and the carpetbaggers robbed his family of their lands, the genteel plantation life. His father, who had fought with the Twenty-seventh Georgia Infantry, became a lawyer, and Mattie's father, through murky political connections, moved on to a judgeship in Atlanta. Shortly afterward, in the fall of 1866, his mother died as much of lost dreams as failing health. A grieving youngster, scarcely fourteen, he was appalled when his father promptly took another wife. His time of innocence ended with the wedding. From that day onward, Henry Holliday's only son became a rebellious troublemaker. He spent his time in the woods, avoiding his stepmother and his father, content to hunt deer and wildfowl. Lean and hard, gifted with quick hands and exceptional coordination, he discovered an inborn talent with firearms. Over the intervening years he won shooting contests, defied the Yankee constabulary by carrying a revolver, and often ran away to Atlanta to see Mattie. Finally, when he was twenty, and steadfastly refused to study for the legal profession, his father shipped him off to dental college in Baltimore. He had not returned to Valdosta since, a matter of some four years. The law offices of Henry Holliday were located on the north side of the courthouse square. He looked up from a sheaf of legal documents as his son came through the door and halted before his desk. He managed a strained smile. "Well, well," he said, somewhat taken aback. "The prodigal son returns. To what do I owe the pleasure?" "Good breeding," Holliday said dryly. "If nothing else, you taught me duty, and manners. I've come to say good-bye." "Have you, indeed?" the elder Holliday replied. "And where are you off to now?" "Somewhere out West, perhaps Texas. I hear Dallas is more civilized than most." "Why on earth would you move west?" "A matter of health. I'm told my constitution requires a drier climate." Henry Holliday appeared startled. He looked closer, saw that his son was pale and wasted, abnormally thin. "What is it, John? Are you ill?" "In a manner of speaking," Holliday said. "I have tuberculosis. Otherwise known as consumption." "My God, you can't be serious! How ill are you?" "I'd thought to send you a telegram. But then, after some consideration, I thought it was better done in person. You might say this is our final parting." "You're--" His father faltered, searching for words. "You came all this way to tell me you're dying?" Holliday was struck by a sudden fit of coughing. He wiped his mouth with a handkerchief, noting that the sputum was tinged red. "I'm touched by your concern. You've made the trip worthwhile." "You're my son, for God's sake! What did you expect?" "Actually, I came here with a request. I could hardly tell all to Uncle George, particularly since he's not one to keep a secret. That being the case--would you look after Mattie for me?" "You haven't told her the truth?" "Let's say she believes it to be a temporary condition." "So she still thinks you're to be married?" "For now," Holliday amended. "Time will convince her otherwise." "I see." The elder Holliday looked at him with a dimming stare, as though he wanted to say something but it was too late. "When the time comes, I'll do what I can for Mattie. You have my word on it." "Good-bye, Father." Holliday extended his hand. "I'm catching the afternoon train back to Atlanta. I appreciate your help." "Come now, John, why rush off?" His father held theirhandshake a moment longer. "Won't you stay the night?" "Thank you, no. I leave for Texas tomorrow." "Well then, will you write me? Once you've settled?" "We've never been much for letters, have we?" "John ... what do you want me to say--you're my son." "I think that says it all, Father. I wish you well." "Godspeed, John. You'll ever be in my prayers." Holliday nodded, quickly turning away, and walked to the door. As he stepped outside, the clock on the courthouse tower tolled the hour. He paused, staring upward, oddly reminded of a poem he'd studied in college. He thought it was by John Donne. &nbsp; <br> Never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee. A slight, ironic smile touched the corner of Holliday's mouth. All of it seemed somehow fitting, appropriate to the moment. He walked toward the train station.

Listen to a little more of this and could be it&#x2019;ll be funny to you too. But probably not. My guess, anyone listening to this won&#x2019;t find much amusement. If you believe it, that is. You don&#x2019;t believe it, you&#x2019;ll probably just about die laughing. I would.<br><br>I wonder how I did die.<br><br>So many goddamn options. The mind fucking boggles. But probably I just got plain shot. Course, seeing as how many times I&#x2019;ve been shot before, it must have been a well-placed bullet. Or just a lot of them all at once. Then again, I knew a guy in my line who got machine- gunned more than once and lived to tell about it both times.<br><br>(laughter)<br><br>Lived to tell about it. That&#x2019;s funny. But you got to be in on the joke.<br><br>I was put in on the joke when I was sixteen. Happened in a bathroom at CBGB during a Ramones gig in &#x2019;77. What it was, a guy was paying me twenty bucks to hand-job him, and while I was doing it he chewed a hole in my neck and started slurping.<br><br>(laughter)<br><br>Okay, maybe you had to be there.<br><br>That guy, if I could have ever got my hands on that guy. I got my hands on plenty of other people I had a problem with. But I&#x2019;m not the type to keep score.<br><br>(laughter)<br><br>Trust me, the jokes don&#x2019;t get any better the rest of the way.<br><br>What I notice about getting older, things that seemed funny before just seem boring or stupid or sad. Things that shouldn&#x2019;t seem funny at all suddenly have a lighter side. No, that&#x2019;s not it. Nothing lighter about it. More that things you never thought you&#x2019;d laugh at you find yourself laughing at because you got no other choice. Like the alternative is you go digging under the sink for some Dra�no to guzzle.<br><br>(laughter)<br><br>See what I mean.<br><br>Tell the truth, this is the most I&#x2019;ve laughed in forever. Not literally forever, I&#x2019;m not that old. But, yeah, something about this is hitting the funny bone.<br><br>Probably it&#x2019;s the idea of you, whoever you are, listening to this. For you, this is one of two things. Either it&#x2019;s the lamest prank ever, or it&#x2019;s too little too late. If you&#x2019;re listening to this, either everything has blown up and everyone knows everything, or it hasn&#x2019;t. Either way, I&#x2019;m gonna tell it.<br><br>So.<br><br>So, hey, here&#x2019;s some trivia for you. Did you know a pregnant woman has about forty percent greater blood volume than a woman who&#x2019;s not pregnant? Take a woman, she&#x2019;s a hundred and ten pounds. Her blood volume is about seven percent of that. Eight point eight-seven pints. Or thereabouts. Call it nine pints. Over her first two trimesters she&#x2019;s gonna add forty percent more volume. Little over three and a half more pints. Going into her last trimester, she&#x2019;s hauling twelve and a half pints.<br><br>More than a fat man.<br><br>That much blood, you can stretch that two or three months. One body in the ground and you&#x2019;re above it for another sixty to ninety days.<br><br>Well, two bodies in the ground.<br><br>What&#x2019;s that worth, that extra forty percent, over a regular person and their seven to ten pints, what&#x2019;s that extra worth?<br><br>The blood of a pregnant woman and her baby, what&#x2019;s the price on that?<br><br>(laughter)<br><br>I&#x2019;m not laughing &#x2019;cause I think it&#x2019;s funny. It&#x2019;s just I&#x2019;m all out of Dra�no.<br><br>So.<br><br>Just tell it like it happened. That&#x2019;s what she said. Like talking is a gift I have or something. Well, better talking than writing. You had to make sense of this by reading my chicken scratch you&#x2019;d be crying not laughing.<br><br>So.<br><br>And that wasn&#x2019;t a rhetorical question by the way. I know the price. The blood of a pregnant woman goes for about twenty grand. That&#x2019;s the price in dollars anyway.<br><br>There&#x2019;s all kinds of prices you can pay for such a thing. Parts of yourself that will never grow back.<br><br>But that&#x2019;s the story. And I&#x2019;m supposed to tell it. Like it happened.<br><br>So okay.<br><br>So I&#x2019;m a Vampyre. Spelled with a Y instead of an I. Capitalized like it&#x2019;s a name. Don&#x2019;t ask me, just tradition I guess. Anyway. Vampyre with a Y, that&#x2019;s the real deal. With an I, that&#x2019;s for scaring babies.<br><br>I&#x2019;m the kind that scares everyone.<br><br>And when this started, I was a secret. Lived in an apartment, just like you. Well, just like you if you kept a mini-fridge of blood. When it ended, I was living in a sewer. Downward mobility being a danger to my kind.<br><br>Should be a punch line for something: Vampyre in a sewer.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s not.<br><br>It&#x2019;s my life.<br><br>(laughter)<br><br>Still, it makes me laugh.<br><br>So.<br><br>This is what happened.<br><br>I can feel it, that little extra bit of heat. And smell staleness in the air. Heat and carbon dioxide, a combination that equals life. Something breathing and exhaling, the air filling its lungs, the oxygen being absorbed. Something warm and breathing, you can count on at least one thing about it. It&#x2019;s full of blood.<br><br>Ahead of me in the dark, something alive.<br><br>Alive for now anyway.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t expect him to be so much trouble to find. When he ran down Freedom Tunnel he was soaked in the cripple&#x2019;s blood; so not like there was much chance I&#x2019;d lose the scent. I figured to stroll after him, kick some garbage every now and then to let him know I was there, keep him running until he keeled over gasping and wormed his way into some crack in the walls. I figured the hardest part would be deciding if I wanted to let him cut me a little while I reached in to drag him out, or if I wanted to look around for something I could ram down his hiding place a few times until I cracked his head open.<br><br>Then he went shit-diving.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know if it was a plan he had, the way he went spastic and cut up the cripple makes me think planning isn&#x2019;t his forte, but when he dropped out of the train tunnel and wallowed in a bank of sewage that had washed up in the storm drain below he put me off the scent.<br><br>Went from tracking a guy who smelled like an abattoir to a guy who smelled like a porto-potty. Which pretty much describes the way everything under Manhattan smells.<br><br>Got dicey after that. Cagey little fucker realized I wasn&#x2019;t right on his ass, he started to calm down a bit, caught his breath some, stopped panting so much, stopped stumbling so much, started picking spots he could hole up a minute at a time and be quiet. If there&#x2019;d been any kind of light at all I&#x2019;d just have started throwing rocks at him until he went down. All I needed was one of those odd reflections you get down here sometimes. Sunlight filters through the grates over the train tunnels, a spear of it finds its way down a sluice, it reflects in some runoff from the sewers and you find a whole section of drain takes on a haze of light. Enough so you might see an idea of your hand if you held it an inch from your eyes. That&#x2019;s you. Me, I&#x2019;d see a damn sight more than my hand. But even my eyes need some light to work with. Something to reflect off the surfaces and show me what they are.<br><br>Instead I&#x2019;m blind. Whether that means it&#x2019;s night up top I couldn&#x2019;t say. Been some time since I&#x2019;ve kept track of the hour. Used to be I knew sunup and sundown like my own heartbeat. But after you miss a couple hundred of each you start to lose that sense.<br><br>The guy ahead of me is just as blind, but he knows the drains. Been down here I don&#x2019;t know how many years. Since he was a kid most probably. Since someone kicked him loose to make his way on his own and he realized the tunnels might be dark, but they were a better place for not getting fucked with than the streets. In the land of the lost, no one empties a gas can over you and lights a match just to see what happens next. Sure people kill each other, but not for no reason other than you&#x2019;re sleeping in a gutter in their neighborhood. Everyone down here has slept in more than one gutter. They got nothing to prove. When they kill down here it&#x2019;s for something that matters. Stove fuel. A bottle of wine. A dead guy&#x2019;s good boots.<br><br>What the guy breathing out carbon dioxide up ahead of me killed the cripple over I can&#x2019;t say. What it was made me take off after him is a little easier to figure.<br><br>Figure it was because he did it near the mouth of Freedom Tunnel not far from where the graffiti kids come crawling around to see the work that Amtrak never bothered to paint over when they started running trains through there again. Figure there&#x2019;s no telling if one of those kids might have seen it happen and might be up top right now talking to the cops about murder in the tunnels. Mostly the cops are pretty fucking happy not to do any enforcing down here. Let justice take its own course. But a nasty slashing witnessed by a Columbia fine arts student might encourage them to put together a squad of troopers with helmets and shields to come down here, break up the shanties, club some skulls and drag some asses up top for a grilling and a few days in one of their holes.<br><br>Not that I&#x2019;m any too likely to get caught up in a sweep like that, but I have an interest in the moles maintaining something like a stable community. More stable it is down here, the less likely they&#x2019;ll get spooked and spread out. More stable it is, the more moles get drawn in. The more moles, the more camouflage for someone looking to be lost.<br><br>And the more to eat.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not fattening up or anything. Far from it. Rarely been leaner have I. But in a population dominated by drunks and junkies, it&#x2019;s generally not too hard to find someone passed out or on the nod who you can tap for a pint in the darkness. Don&#x2019;t get greedy and you can hit a vein just about any time you need one.<br><br>So figure that&#x2019;s one reason I took off after the guy. To keep my good thing from getting fucked with. But figure it was probably more about all that blood hitting the wall in a spray. The smell of it was a punch in the face. My eyes and my mouth watered and I was on my feet and running after the guy before I even thought about cops. Before I thought about anything else, I was thinking how nobody was gonna care what I did to this guy. How it was gonna be dark in the tunnels while I ran him down. How good it was gonna be to rip a hole in him and drink until I was so full I was gagging on him. How I wanted a damn drink after all the sipping I&#x2019;d been doing.<br><br>No, I don&#x2019;t know why he killed the cripple. And I don&#x2019;t much care. I just care that I&#x2019;m blind right now and he knows the drains better than me and he&#x2019;s just there, him and his blood. Question is, did he stop because he hit a dead end, or because he thinks he&#x2019;s got a play he can make.<br><br>Cold shit is bumping against my ankles and flowing toward him. There&#x2019;s a loud gurgle and suck a few yards ahead.<br><br>My first month down here, I found myself in a drain like this, just trying to map out the new turf, thought I was as deep as it goes, took a step and found out it goes deeper. Dropped straight about eight yards, hit brick and cobbles, a shard of rust snagged the back of my thigh and ripped it knee to ass. Lost enough blood before the wound started to clot that I went spinny-headed. That time I had a flashlight on me. Hadn&#x2019;t been using it because I wanted to learn how to work the dark, but I had it on me. If I hadn&#x2019;t, if it had broken in the fall, I&#x2019;d maybe never have found my way out.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t have a flashlight this time. I go down a suck hole and I&#x2019;ll be gone. Little fucker up there, laying for me, thinking he&#x2019;s got this wired now that we&#x2019;re on his turf, he&#x2019;s got me wanting to make things hard for him. But I got to know where he is first.<br><br>I wonder how crazy he is.<br><br>And I make a play to find out.<br><br>&#x2014;Hey.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>&#x2014;Let me ask you something.<br><br>Still quiet.<br><br>&#x2014;Why&#x2019;d you go and kill the cripple?<br><br>He inhales, like a guy about to say his piece, then lets it out, says nothing.<br><br>I keep up my end of the conversation.<br><br>&#x2014;Mean, just because he was a cripple, that doesn&#x2019;t mean you didn&#x2019;t have a reason for killing him. Just &#x2019;cause the guy didn&#x2019;t have a lower body, that doesn&#x2019;t mean he didn&#x2019;t do something to deserve it. I knew a guy, blind, blind as a bat blind, couldn&#x2019;t see shit. Know what being blind did for his personality? Nothing. Guy was a prick. A blind prick. A drunk, blind prick. Closing time at this bar I used to work the door, someone had to always walk this blind prick home. When I drew that short straw, I&#x2019;d walk the fucker to a vacant lot, let him pass out on the ground. He&#x2019;d come in the next night, be a prick about the deal, tell people what I&#x2019;d done. Know what they did? They patted me on the back. All of them knew he deserved it. A guy&#x2019;s a cripple, that doesn&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;s charming.<br><br>I hear him licking his lips, just dying to say something. But he doesn&#x2019;t.<br><br>I do.<br><br>&#x2014;Maybe not, though. Maybe your cripple was a great guy. Could be you&#x2019;re a crazy asshole who lost his shit and cut up a perfectly good cripple for no reason other than you got tired of listening to his wheels squeaking.<br><br>&#x2014;He stole my fucking girlfriend.<br><br>That was really all I need, just the sound of his voice, the echo behind it as it bounced off the drain walls and ceiling, that pretty much pins him down for me. Close enough I can jump over anything between us, a few yards maybe, no worry about going down a suck hole. Once I&#x2019;m on him there won&#x2019;t be anything at all to worry about.<br><br>But my curiosity gets hold of me.</p><h2>A Dawn of Dragons: Bk. 6 (Young Adventures S.)</h2><p>The third Dragonlance novel in the trilogy that launched the entire Dragonlance novel line, <i>Dragons of Spring Dawning</i>, has been adapted to a format specifically targeted at young readers.

Novick&#x2019;s <i>Henry James: The Young Master</i> to &#x201c;a movie of James&#x2019;s life, as it unfolds, moment to moment, lending the book a powerful immediacy.&#x201d; Now, in <i>Henry James: The Mature Master</i>, Novick completes his super, revelatory two-volume account of one of the world&#x2019;s most gifted and least understood authors, and of a vanished world of aristocrats and commoners.<br><br>Using hundreds of letters only recently made available and taking a fresh look at primary materials, Novick reveals a man utterly unlike the passive, repressed, and privileged observer painted by other biographers. Henry James is seen anew, as a passionate and engaged man of his times, driven to achieve greatness and fame, drawn to the company of other men, able to write with sensitivity about women as he shared their experiences of love and family responsibility.<br><br>James, age thirty-eight as the volume begins, basking in the success of his first major novel, <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i>, is a literary lion in danger of being submerged by celebrity. As his finances ebb and flow he turns to the more lucrative world of the stage&#x2013;with far more success than he has generally been credited with. Ironically, while struggling to excel in the theatre, James writes such prose masterpieces as <i>The Wings of the Dove </i>and <i>The Golden Bowl</i>.<br><br>Through an astonishingly prolific life, James still finds time for profound friendships and intense rivalries. <i>Henry James: The Mature Master</i> features vivid new portraits of James&#x2019;s famous peers, including Edith Wharton, Oscar Wilde, and Robert Louis Stevenson; his close and loving siblings Alice and William; and the many compelling young men, among them Hugh Walpole and Howard Sturgis, with whom James exchanges professions of love and among whom he thrives. We see a master converting the materials of an active life into great art.<br><br>Here, too, as one century ends and another begins, is James&#x2019;s participation in the public events of his native America and adopted England. As the still-feudal European world is shaken by democracy and as America sees itself endangered by a wave of Jewish and Italian immigrants, a troubled James wrestles with his own racial prejudices and his desire for justice. With the coming of world war all other considerations are set aside, and James enlists in the cause of civilization, leaving his greatest final works unwritten.<br><br>Hailed as a genius and a warm and charitable man&#x2013;and derided by enemies as false, effeminate, and self-infatuated&#x2013;Henry James emerges here as a major and complex figure, a determined and ambitious artist who was planning a new novel even on his deathbed. In <i>Henry James: The Mature Master</i>, he is at last seen in full; along with its predecessor volume, this book is bound to become the definitive biography.</p><p>Sheldon M. Novick is the author of <i>Henry James: The Mature Master, Henry James: The Young Master </i>and <i>Honorable Justice: The Life of Oliver Wendell Holmes</i>, and is the editor of <i>The Collected Works of Justice Holmes</i>. He is Adjunct Professor of Law and History at Vermont Law School, and lives in Norwich, Vermont.<p>Reviewed by Edwin M. Yoder Jr.</p><p>The faintly redundant subtitle is easily explained: The fifth and last volume of Leon Edel's classic Henry James biography was called simply The Master, echoing the honorific conferred on the great storyteller by his friends. James has remained "The Master," and Edel's biography (1953-1972) is among the greatest in the language. Nonetheless, the short verdict on this concluding volume of Sheldon M. Novick's two-part biography (the first, The Young Master, appeared a decade ago) is that it weathers the Edel test. It is fluent, confident, informed (at times excessively so, since Novick burdens it with many relatively inconsequential James letters), and it is also perceptive and sensible. </p><p>Good sense is a quality that too much writing about James lacks. The fatuity of some recent portraiture may be seen in a tall tale of which Novick is properly skeptical. James was close friends with the novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson, whose 1894 death in Venice, perhaps by suicide, deeply disturbed him. Decades after her death, James's devoted attentions to her memory gave rise to the bizarre story that James had himself rowed out into the Venetian lagoon and there attempted to "sink" Miss Woolson's dresses, only to see them bob stubbornly to the surface. The tale rests on the recollection of an elderly Italian lady, 62 years later, who said (in a BBC broadcast) that she heard it from James. It has been catnip for credulous biographers, so that James, a man of sane and settled habits, emerges as the weirdest of eccentrics. Novick calls the tale "improbable," and he is right. </p><p>The story of the unsinkable dresses is, however, typical of Jamesian apocrypha on which barrels of ink are regularly squandered -- along with the propensity of some critics to lock him in an ivory tower that belies James's humanity. Given these hazards, any volume that treats the writer's middle to late years (roughly 1881 to his death of congestive heart failure in 1916) must confront certain well-worn issues, among which two are paramount: one personal, the other literary. On the personal side, what about his sexual life? And on the literary side, what about the alleged obscurity of his "late style," the experimental narrative manner he developed following his disappointed efforts as a playwright in the 1890s?</p><p>The issue of James's sexuality suggests why many great writers, including James, have taken a dim view of literary biography in which, so often, the body of work takes a back seat to prurient curiosity about the writer's private life. The preoccupation with James's sex life may be traced to the second thoughts Edel expressed in a 1985 abridged edition of his five-volume work. Edel observed that times and manners had changed, and he had "discard[ed] certain former reticences . . . . No biographer can tell 'everything,' [but] we are able to offer a more forthright record of personal relations, of deeper emotions and sexual fantasies." </p><p>What Edel cautiously intimated, bumptious successors have made into an obsessive focus. Novick, writing on the heels of attempts to join James to gay-lib ideology, deals with this delicate issue by implication. His treatment is muted and insinuating, since there are no certainties. For those persuaded, as Novick seems to be, that James led a secret homosexual life, such evidence as he presents lies in gushing letters to young male friends that speak of enfolding arms and other endearments. To our ears, such figures may hint at carnal passion, although the Victorian implications may well have been more conventional. But writers live mainly in their work, and in James's case the question of sexuality is neither more nor less relevant than it is in, say, Shakespeare's explicitly androgynous sonnets. </p><p>As for James's late style, of which Novick writes with sympathy and perception, it often provokes the charge of obscurity that has been leveled against many of the modern masters of prose fiction and prompts the question: Did such revolutionists as James, Proust, Joyce and Faulkner lose touch with their era? Or did the era, dulled by mass-media banality, lose touch with them? James's late style is thickly metaphorical and pictorial and, though intricate in syntax, far less so in the fiction than in the late autobiographical works. </p><p>As a critic, Novick turns in a hit-and-miss performance, uneven on the earlier works. (He is fond of the dubious notion that Jamesian characters are modeled on living persons.) On the later works he is better, writing with a delicate appreciation of James's mature style. As he shows, it exploited what James called "the divine scenic method," a new way of seeing that recalls Conrad's remark that the storyteller's task is "above all, to make you see." It was a byproduct of his playwriting experience and his determination to embody in his tales all the subtleties of human awareness. In the pursuit of those subtleties, James created privileged observers whom he came to call "reflectors," who see the action -- as E.M. Forster joked -- "through lenses procured from a rather too first-class oculist."</p><p>The issue has been much canvassed, but rarely as well as here in this very readable portrait. Novick has given us a Henry James who is not only artistically heroic but entirely admirable as colleague, friend, companion and brother -- as he was in life. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Human industry and consumption of resources have altered the climate, polluted the water and soil, destroyed ecosystems, and rendered many species extinct, vastly increasing the likelihood of an ecological catastrophe. How did humankind come to rule nature to such an extent? To regard the planet&#x2019;s resources and creatures as ours for the taking? To find ourselves on a seemingly relentless path toward ecocide?<p></p><p>In <i>After Eden</i>, Kirkpatrick Sale answers these questions in a radically new way. Integrating research in paleontology, archaeology, and anthropology, he points to the beginning of big-game hunting as the origin of <i>Homo sapiens</i>&#x2019; estrangement from the natural world. Sale contends that a new, recognizably modern human culture based on the hunting of large animals developed in Africa some 70,000 years ago in response to a fierce plunge in worldwide temperature triggered by an enormous volcanic explosion in Asia. Tracing the migration of populations and the development of hunting thousands of years forward in time, he shows that hunting became increasingly adversarial in relation to the environment as people fought over scarce prey during Europe&#x2019;s glacial period between 35,000 and 10,000 years ago. By the end of that era, humans&#x2019; idea that they were the superior species on the planet, free to exploit other species toward their own ends, was well established.</p><p><i>After Eden</i> is a sobering tale, but not one without hope. Sale asserts that <i>Homo erectus</i>, the variation of the hominid species that preceded Homo sapiens and survived for nearly two million years, did not attempt to dominate the environment. He contends that vestiges of this more ecologically sound way of life exist today&#x2014;in some tribal societies, in the central teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism, and in the core principles of the worldwide environmental movement&#x2014;offering redemptive possibilities for ourselves and for the planet.</p></p><p>&#34;The things that Kirkpatrick Sale writes about are near and dear to me--things that I have spent most of my adult life thinking deeply about. Seldom would I have the confidence to reach judgments from the evidence as boldly as does Sale, but I suspect that he is right in most of his conclusions.&#34;--Steven E.

After five subsequent <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, Margolin now returns to the haunting terrain of <em>Gone, but Not Forgotten</em> with a mesmerizing tour de force of psychological suspense, an electrifying tale of revenge and retribution that shows a master storyteller at the very peak of his craft.</p><p><em>Thursday: Subject is still combative after four days of applied pain, sleep deprivation and minimal food.</em></p><p>Vice squad detective Bobby Vasquez, for months on the trail of a slippery underworld figure, receives an anonymous tip that directs him to a mountain cabin. He races through the idyllic Oregon woods, expecting to close the book on a long-standing vendetta. What he finds instead opens a Pandora's box of horror that will haunt him to his dying day.</p><p><em>8:10: Subject bound and gaffed and placed in upstairs closet at end of hall.

Facing a seemingly insurmountable wall of evidence, he turns to Portland's top criminal defense attorney, Frank Jaffe-who, along with his ambitious daughter, Amanda, must put on an inspired defense. Amanda's first taste of criminal defense work is as intoxicating as it is chilling, but it raises moral questions she's loath to address. Is she defending an innocent man? Or is she using her considerable skills to set a monster free? Then Cardoni disappears under bizarre circumstances. Four years later, a second set of murders has begun ....</p><p><em>8:55: Subject exits house, naked and barefoot, armed with kitchen knife. Remarkable strength of character. Breaking her will be a challenge.</em></p><p>Has Cardoni resurfaced to ply his deadly trade anew? Is there a copycat killer? Or has the real killer been someone else all along? The police will do everything they can to stop Cardoni -- but they have to find him first.</p><p>Following a twisting trail of clues, including a harrowing diary that clinically records the killer's horrible deeds, Amanda Jaffe and Bobby Vasquez join the hunt-and themselves become targets of the twenty-first century's first genuinely monstrous psychopath. </p>:</p><p>When a killing field is unearthed in the Oregon woods, it's linked to a Portland surgeon whose increasingly aggressive behavior and explosive temper have already drawn the attention of his colleagues. Neophyte attorney Amanda Jaffe takes second chair to her father, a successful criminal lawyer retained by Dr. Vincent Cardoni when he is charged with multiple counts of murder. The victims have one thing in common: they are missing vital organs, which were clearly harvested by an expert surgeon. In this explosive and fast-paced suspense thriller, the forensic evidence against Cardoni is so convincing that even after his acquittal on a technicality, the reader, like Amanda, is sure of his guilt. And when a similar field of mutilated bodies turns up years later, Cardoni is again the primary suspect. But Cardoni has disappeared, and this time it's his former wife, Justine Castle, who's implicated in the new crimes, and Amanda who's retained as the lead attorney in the case.<p> The particulars of the killings are so similar to the first set of murders that Amanda is convinced Cardoni is involved. When he is found to be working at the same hospital where he was once a promising surgeon (this time as a custodian and under an assumed name), she draws the logical conclusion. But when she finds Cardoni's severed hand at the scene of the crimes, she is forced to rethink the assumptions on which her defense of the doctor's ex-wife is based. Could Justine, in fact, be the killer? Author Phillip Margolin's newest book moves at an almost frantic pace. Bodies pile up, evidence mounts, and everything points to Cardoni's guilt until the end, a stunner that surprises Amanda as well as the reader. This chilling, deftly crafted novel will hold the reader's attention to the last page. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Self-Coached Runner II: Cross Country and the Shorter Distances</h2><p>Provides comprehensive coaching information for runners who compete at the ten thousand meter or longer distances</p><p></p><h2>Three Hours (A Ewert Grens Thriller, 7)</h2><p><b>"The Swedes have a lock on hard-hitting crime novels... the latest in a string of superb procedurals written by Anders Roslund and Borge Hellstrom."--Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times</i></b> <b><b><br></b>The explosive third novel in the Ewert Grens-Piet Hoffmann trilogy, which began with <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Three Seconds</i>.</b><br><br>Stockholm, Sweden: Seventy-three refugees have been found dead, suffocated in a container at Varta harbor.<br><br>Niamey, Niger: Ewert Grens arrives in a city he's never heard of, in search of a man he never thought he would see again.<br><br>Piet Hoffmann has again got himself in too deep, infiltrating a West African trafficking ring.

Slovotsky's personal preference for that sort of thing was to anchor a foot or leg with a thrown knife from a bit more distance.<br>If he had to engage in a sword fight at all.<br>That wouldn't be anything close to Walter Slovotsky's preferred method of settling a serious argument. A well-sighted rifle at one hundred yards was far preferable, and if the opponent was missing a leg, blindfolded, hobbled, and tied to a stake with a nice circular target pinned over his heart, that would make it all the better.<br>But in life, enemies were rarely considerate enough to arrange things so conveniently, alas. Sometimes--too often--they weren't even considerate enough to identify themselves. Even to themselves.<br>It made for more complication than one would like; it made the dowager empress's naked hatred almost refreshing, by contrast. Almost.<br>"Perhaps you didn't hear me," the emperor said, irritated. "I said, that I thought it was my point."<br>"No, I don't think so," Walter Slovotsky said. He raised his practice sword again in salute. "Or perhaps you're changing the rules on me here when you allow me to change them on more important things?"<br>He couldn't make out Thomen's facial expression through his mask, but a stiffness in the shoulders and posture said that he caught the emperor by surprise. That was a good thing, in moderation. Moderation had its virtues; there was a reason that the term in Dwarvish for dwarves meant "the Moderate People," and Walter Slovotsky liked dwarves, generally.<br>Not that Walter Slovotsky was a big believer in moderation for himself. Nor even a moderate believer in moderation, come to think of it.<br>Thomen didn't answer, at first, then: "Very well. Your point it is." His breath was coming in audible pants, and he removed his mask for a moment as he walked to a side table and poured himself a goblet of water and drank it in one large gulp before setting it back down.<br>He was, for all his flaws, a handsome man, strength of will showing in the bones of his face, and in the too rarely blinking eyes that seemed to miss nothing. His hair was black, jet black, the black of a raven's wing, but his close-cropped beard was shot with gray, as though he was only giving in by stages to the pressures of the Silver Crown and throne of Holtun-Bieme.<br>But as he returned from the side table, there was still that spring in his step that had been too long absent, and Walter Slovotsky wondered if the cause was the program of rest and recreation that Walter and Bren Adahan had talked him into, or whether it was the admittedly lovely Lady Leria that Kethol had brought back from Barony Keranahan.<br>No reason it couldn't be both, of course.<br>"Have at it, shall we?" Thomen asked, replacing his mask.<br>He was loosening up some, granted, Slovotsky decided, but somebody really ought to do something to remove that metaphorical broomstick he had stuck up his butt.<br>The throne room was empty, well, as empty as it got.<br>The Kiaran tapestries still covered the walls; if you squinted, you could almost have believed that you were in a green glen, surrounded by capering fawns frozen in mid-leap by some artistic wizard.<br>The throne itself and the smaller one next to it for the dowager empress--the old, and mean, vicious one, not Andrea Cullinane--remained on their podium, and the long banquet table had been separated into component parts, smaller tables that interlocked at their ends like jigsaw puzzles, and stacked in pairs, top-to-top, in the corner farthest from the great hearth. The thick carpets had been rolled up and carried away to be beaten in the open air, and replaced before Parliament met.<br>But there were no guards or servants, although the latter were as close as the pull of a bell-rope, and the former as close as a loud yell for help.<br>But Walter Slovotsky was one of the few people allowed to come into the emperor's presence either armed or unescorted, and one of the <i>very</i> few allowed into the presence both armed and unescorted--that came with the job of imperial proctor--and neither he nor Thomen particularly wanted House troops to see the emperor lose a point in an embarrassing way.<br>Or, for that matter, to see Slovotsky himself do so. For the emperor, it would be undignified, and Slovotsky had his own legend--read: unwarranted reputation--to maintain.<br>Besides, as much as such a thing was possible under the circumstances, Slovotsky and the emperor were friends, and friends could always use some time to themselves.<br>Straw had been scattered over the bare stone floor, to make the footing more treacherous. In a real fight, you could never count on having good footing beneath you, and Murphy--who, Walter Slovotsky explained to the locals, was the Spirit of Fighting and Battles on the Other Side, which was more true than not--would make sure you never did.<br>Thomen raised his sword in salute, which Slovotsky echoed, and they closed again. This time, Slovotsky tried to draw an attack, but Thomen read the spacing between the two of them better than Slovotsky had, and closed with a quick bounce that led him parry Slovotsky's counter, and then score easily on Slovotsky's sword arm before bouncing back out of range.<br>"Not bad." Walter Slovotsky stepped back and pulled off his mask. There had to be something more comfortable than this boiled-leather hood, ventilated with barely enough slits. An Other Side fencing mask would be ideal, but that would require stiff wire mesh, and New Pittsburgh was far too busy with more important production.<br>Eventually. There were other uses for wire mesh, after all. It would be nice to have all the windows of the castle unshuttered on a hot afternoon, and let the breeze blow through without turning it into a refuge for every bloodsucking bug in the Middle Lands.<br>Slovotsky had to force himself not to scratch at the maddeningly itching cluster at the base of the back of his neck. The fencing mask had been rubbing at the bites, making them worse than usual.<br>It had all been much worse last night than usual, and Slovotsky and Aiea had spent too much of it alternately unshuttering their window when it got too hot and stuffy, and then closing it when the mosquitoes took the open window as an open invitation.<br>Well, if nobody else was going to do it, Slovotsky didn't mind confronting the wizard. Walter and Henrad went way back, after all.<br>"Again," the Emperor commanded, lowering his own mask. "Have at you," he said, in English, the words slurred.<br>"Gesundheit."<br>"Eh?"<br>"Oh. That's English for 'As you would have it, my Emperor.'"<br>"A compact language, this Englits of yours. I should make it a point to learn more of it."<br>"It has its virtues," Walter said, moving in. "Baron Minister Adahan has noted that one, on more than one occasion."<br>They were well into a complicated sequence of counter, riposte, and counter-riposte that was, Slovotsky thought, destined to end with the emperor's blade just enough out of line for Slovotsky to beat it to one side, when the door creaked open behind him.<br>That was enough of a distraction that Thomen was able to judge the distance better than Slovotsky could, and ended the point with a well-judged stop-thrust that actually stung.<br>Slovotsky managed a too late parry, and spun around in annoyance, prepared to give whoever it was a few choice words about interrupting.<br>He was only slightly surprised and vaguely disappointed to see that it was the dowager empress herself, a thin smile on her pinched face as she silently tapped her fingertips together in applause.<br>Well, <i>a</i> dowager empress, at least: Beralyn Furnael, the Emperor's mother. It would have been a lot nicer to see Andrea Cullinane, the late emperor's widow. It wasn't just that Andrea was as lovely from skin to bone as Beralyn was ugly, although that certainly helped things.<br>"Well struck," she said. "Well struck, indeed."<br>Thomen had his mask off and his sword tucked under his arm as he walked swiftly to her for a quick and dutiful kiss.<br>"Good afternoon, Mother," he said. "You're looking well today."<br>She chuckled thinly. "Bieme and the whole Empire are fortunate that you can lie so easily and so well, Thomen. Truth is only an occasional tool of statecraft."<br>Actually, she looked about the same way she usually did, a collection of lumpy flesh covered in black muslin, topped by a sagging-jawed face that was itself framed by a tight helmet of gray hair fastened in a severe bun, small, piggish eyes softening only for a moment when she looked at her son, but har...</p><h2>Queen Dolley</h2><p>A biographical novel about Dolley Madison, the charismatic First Lady who, in the War of 1812, rescued a portrait of George Washington from the walls of a White House that was being burned by the British</p><p>Dorothy Clarke Wilson (1904-2003) was a prolific and popular author of numerous literary works, including books, plays and essays and she was also a well-known lecturer. Ms. Wilson primarily focused on biographical, religious and historical fiction topics. Her body of work, as relevant today as ever, has appealed to generations of American readers and has been translated into more than 50 languages. Collectively, her writings have spawned hundreds of publications resulting in thousands of library holdings.A "biographical novel" or "fictionalized biography" stands astride two distinct if not opposed genres and is likely to slump somewhere between. This one, by the prolific author of some 25 history-based novels, portrays postRevolutionary America in a pedestrian, reportorial style that gives it factual accuracy and smothers it in exhaustive detail but does nothing to provide the breath of life. President James Madison's regal lady Dolley is portrayed as a bustling, tireless whirlwind and sustaining force. We are told rather than convinced, that she is a charmer, an infinitely accomplished hostess and peacemaker. Stouthearted through the War of 1812, Dolley saves Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington from the burning White House, courageously enduring the crises and ordeals of the infant nation. While hardly a standout, the book is well timed in anticipation of next year's Constitution bicentennial celebration.

But we can find peace, hope and strength in the midst of these events. Using the scriptures and modern prophetic revelations, Brother Skousen clearly explains some of the important events that will occur prior to the Savior&#39;s Second Coming, such as: 1. The necessary organizations, laws and covenants which must be established before He comes again, 2. The redemption of the land of Zion and the planning and building of the New Jerusalem, 3. Important events that will take place in the Old World as well as the New World prior to His Return, and 4. The identity of some of those who will play a crucial role in these latter events. Avoiding myths, legends and rumored prophecies, Brother Skousen uses the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets to clearly explain the events that will occur prior to the Savior&#39;s Second Coming. This book offers an impressive message of hope, and how we can prepare for His Return.</p><p></p><h2>Feet Wet; Reflections of a Carrier Pilot.</h2><p>A veteran Navy carrier pilot recounts his nearly thirty years of experience, including combat flights in Vietnam, and explains how carrier aircraft are launched and landed</p><p>Admiral Gillcrist's 33-year career parallels the development of postwar naval aviation and its revolutionary use of jets aboard aircraft carriers. His memoirs are filled with flying stories (his own adventures and those of his shipmates) of hairsbreath escapes and occasional tragedies, all proving something we already knew; this is dangerous work. There is also history on postwar carrier developments in general, and on how naval aviation adapted to the challenge of the Vietnam War. While some subject background would aid the reader in understanding this capably and enthusiastically written history, it is still a remarkable window into the high-pressure world of the carrier pilot. For those closer to the field, the account rings with absolute authenticity.<br><i>- Mel D.

Countering the prevailing colonialist view that global hip hop is an exotic and derivative outgrowth of an African-American-owned idiom subject to assessment in terms of American norms and standards, Global Noise shows how international hip hop scenes, like those in France and Australia, developed by first adopting then adapting US models and establishing an increasing hybridity of local linguistic and musical features. The essays reveal diasporic manifestations of international hip hop that are rarely acknowledged in the growing commentary on the genre in the US. In the voices of rappers from around the globe with divergent backgrounds of race, nationality, class and gender, the authors find a consistent rhetoric of opposition and resistance to institutional forms of repression and the construction of a cohesive, historically-based subculture capable of accommodating regional and national diversities.<br><br>CONTRIBUTORS: Roger Chamberland, Ian Condry, David Hesmondhalgh, Claire Levy, Ian Maxwell, Caspar Melville, Sarah Morelli, Mark Pennay, Andr� J.M.

Silicon chips drive just about everything that sucks power, from toys to heart monitors, but their inventors aren't nearly as widely known as Edison and Ford. Journalist T.R. Reid has thoroughly updated <i>The Chip</i>, his 1985 exploration of the life work of inventors Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, to reflect the colossal shift toward smarter gadgets that has taken place since then.<p>Satisfying as both biography and basic science text, the book perfectly captures the independence and near-obsessive problem-solving talents of the two men. Though ultimately only one of them (Noyce) ended up with legal rights to the invention, they shared a respect for each other that persisted throughout their careers. Since Kilby won the 2000 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work, the story is all the more compelling and intriguing over 40 years after the invention. Reid's work uncovers human dimensions we'd never expect to see from 1950s engineering research. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Barely fifty years ago a computer was a gargantuan, vastly expensive thing that only a handful of scientists had ever seen. The world&#39;s brightest engineers were stymied in their quest to make these machines small and affordable until the solution finally came from two ingenious young Americans. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce hit upon the stunning discovery that would make possible the silicon microchip, a work that would ultimately earn Kilby the Nobel Prize for physics in 2000. In this completely revised and updated edition of The Chip, T.R. Reid tells the gripping adventure story of their invention and of its growth into a global information industry. This is the story of how the digital age began.</p><h2>Cautionary Verses: Omnibus Edition (Red Fox Poetry Books)</h2><p>Cautionary Verses</p><p></p><h2>Grave Consequences: A Novel (Grand Tour Series)</h2><p><b>The Powerful, Epic Romance Continues</b>For Cora Kensington, the journey of a lifetime takes unexpected twists.

It scores high on both counts.<p> Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle. </p><p> In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar�, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic of <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> turns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross between <i>The Razor's Edge</i> and <i>Sophie's World</i>, <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> takes us into "the high country of the mind" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>The extraordinary story of a man's quest for truth.

Nine are living legends, like Arnold and Jack. Nine are secret legends, like Dolphus &#x201c;Golf Ball&#x201d; Hull, a windblown tour caddie from Jackson, Mississippi. What they all share is a game that courses through their collective veins like a drug.<br> <br>Accompanied by a sidekick and friend, a former tour player who is a secret legend himself, Bamberger seeks to locate and get to know these luminaries.

One wrong turn and my mind went into a drift. All these old-timey motels hanging on. Which one was it?<br> <br>I was remembering a day from thirty years earlier. More than thirty. It was the night of my brother&#x2019;s college graduation, and I was flying from Boston to Charlotte to caddie in a tournament there, a professional tournament, with stars in the field and a big cardboard check for the winner. Fred Graham, one of Cronkite&#x2019;s lieutenants on CBS News, was on my flight, sitting in first class, smoking a cigar. It was Fred Graham, for sure. He had that scar on his chin.<br> <br>Scars were more common then. When I was growing up&#x2014;in the village of Patchogue on the South Shore of Long Island in the sixties and seventies&#x2014;there were still World War I vets on the benches by the VFW Hall with scars both visible and hidden. (We all knew the phrase combat fatigue.) My baseball hero, Cleon Jones, had a scar on his right cheek, the residue of a young-buck car accident that had sent him flying through a windshield. I learned about this face-changing mishap in Cleon, his 1970 autobiography, which I devoured when it became available at the Patchogue Library. Soon after, in that same library, I found Cleon Jones&#x2019;s phone number in Mobile, Alabama. What a thrill, to look at that exotic 205 area code and imagine the scene on the other end. And in that same vein, here was Fred Graham of CBS News with his positive-ID chin scar. I caught my breath. He was famous, yes, but it was more than that. He was a member of a nomadic tribe&#x2014;newsmen&#x2014;a group forever on the prowl, always going to some new place. It was May 1979. I was newly nineteen and looking to join the circus myself. Not Fred&#x2019;s. It was Golf Road that was calling.<br> <br>Wilkinson Boulevard, when I stumbled on it en route to Augusta all those years later, was just another misstep in a long series of them for me, on the wrong street, likely heading the wrong direction, temperamentally incapable of using a smartphone map. No matter. Little waves of happiness were washing over me.<br> <br>The accidental tourist: I know the concept well. Here I was, in the throes of middle age, and the song of the road was playing at full volume again. It plays for all of us, doesn&#x2019;t it? My own wanderlust is tempered by a powerful desire to get home, be home, stay home. Those urges were especially strong in the years when our kids were in the house. But they had grown into collegians. (My wife, Christine, once brought home a small sign: CHECKOUT TIME IS 18.) And even in our Swim Meet years, the pull of the road was always more than background music. In my line of work&#x2014;sportswriter&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re home too long, something&#x2019;s wrong.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve never had a true office job, and in our married life Christine and I have both always been coming and going. Our honeymoon was seven months in Europe during which I worked as a caddie on Europe&#x2019;s professional golf tour. On long drives, Christine read aloud Richard Halliburton&#x2019;s The Royal Road to Romance. My parents had the massive Arthur Schlesinger biography of RFK that included a photo of Bobby in front of the King David Hotel&#x2014;Jerusalem, 1948&#x2014;when he was twenty-two with a gig as a reporter on the Boston Post. A snap that inspires me to this day.<br> <br>My mother and father left Nazi Germany as children with their parents, and many years later they gave long formal interviews about their wartime experiences. They dressed up for the occasion, which my mother does with ease and my father less so. (His dress shoes all have Vibram soles.) My mother spoke of family vacations in a village near a Czechoslovakian forest in the 1930s and her fascination with the Gypsies on the edge of it, with their dark skin and light feet.<br> <br>In 1959, when Khrushchev was coming to the United States, Mike Wallace was on TV conducting a contest: What one place should U.S. officials take the Soviet leader to show him the real America? The winner would get a car, and our family&#x2014;with me on the way&#x2014;needed one. In my father&#x2019;s entry, he said the American hosts should have Khrushchev throw a dart at a U.S. wall map and wherever it stuck was where he would go, so that Nikita and his comrades back home would understand that democracy thrives everywhere in the United States. How did that not win?<br> <br>One year my brother was given a globe with raised mountain ranges. That was a big deal. Our father had a collection of Mobil travel guides stacked on a basement shelf. I read them front to back. On our family trips, David would read those accordion Hess and Esso road maps for our father like he was reading the back of a baseball card.<br> <br>David and I were devoted to the fine print of American life. We will know forever the name Lou Niss, traveling secretary of the New York Mets in the Cleon Jones years. He was in the team photo annually. What a job. Whatever that position actually entailed, I could not know. But he was at-large. In the agate type of the sports section in the New York Times, under the heading &#x201c;Today&#x2019;s Games,&#x201d; whole cities were in transit: New York at St. Louis, Chicago at Philadelphia, Cincinnati at San Francisco.<br> <br>All my youthful heroes were at-large: the ballplayers and the golfers, the beat writers and the war correspondents, the musicians and their silent roadies. A nod here to some hits from yesteryear: Peter, Paul and Mary singing &#x201c;Five Hundred Miles,&#x201d; Glen Campbell singing &#x201c;Wichita Lineman,&#x201d; David Wiffen singing &#x201c;Driving Wheel.&#x201d; If you told me any of those songs were conceived on the side of the road, it wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me one bit.<br> <br>Just came up on the midnight special<br> <br>Honey, how about that<br> <br>My car broke down in Texas<br> <br>She stopped dead in her tracks.<br> <br>Do you like how Wiffen&#x2019;s car gets the feminine pronoun treatment, as ships and principalities once did? My senior-year roommate called his boat of a station wagon Betsy. Another roommate, a physics major, wanted to be a long-distance truck driver. A high school buddy who shined shoes at the village course where I played in Bellport, one town east of Patchogue, saved his tip money for flying lessons. We were all in transit, at least in our dreams. The touring-caddie thing persisted in me for years.<br> <br>Golf is a road game. Professional golf, of course, but the game as it is played on Sunday mornings, too. You start in one place, head out, have various adventures along the way, turn around, come on home. Chaucer would have had a field day with it, and Updike did. In one of the most beautiful sentences I know, from a short story for the ages, Updike describes an American banker on a Scottish links: &#x201c;This was happiness, on this wasteland between the tracks and the beach, and freedom, of a wild and windy sort.&#x201d;<br> <br>I am certain of little&#x2014;I am leery of the overconfident reporter&#x2014;and at nineteen I knew even less. But I knew what anybody with a TV might know: Every week a group of professional golfers assembled in some new and glamorous place and played a leisurely ball-and-stick game for money and glory. I was never going to be one of those golfers. Even with the advantage of starting young, in gym class at South Ocean Avenue Middle School, I never was much better than an 85 shooter at marshy Bellport, where I knew every hump. (In middle age, I have been besieged with the yips, a putting illness that takes away your desire to write down scores.) But I was aware that the golfers on our family TV all had caddies. That&#x2019;s where I saw my opening and my pathway to the circus.<br> <br>In the winter of &#x2019;79, in the long winter break of freshman year, I had a brief stint catching T-bars flung by dismounting night skiers at the top of the Bald Hill Ski Bowl. (Named, we always said, for its distinct lack of snow.) On a Saturday afternoon in late January I was watching the Andy Williams San Diego Open in my parents&#x2019; living room. If golf was on TV, I watched. (My parents and brother had no interest. I had golf for myself.) At one point, CBS decided to show a journeyman doing nothing more than playing well: Randy Erskine, a reliable voice told us, of Battle Creek, Michigan.<br> <br>I located this Randy Erskine of Battle Creek as I located Cleon Jones of Mobile. I wrote to him and asked him for a summer job as his traveling caddie. If the phrase tour caddie existed then, I doubt I knew it. The letter led to a phone call, which led me to a flight to Charlotte, site of the Kemper Open, on a May evening in 1979, when Fred Graham was sitting up front.<br> <br>I headed out of the Charlotte airport that night and walked over to Wilkinson Boulevard and found a motel room for maybe fifteen dollars. It had to be the first night I was alone in a rented room. Early the next morning, the lady owner gave me a bowl of Raisin Bran and a tiny glass of orange juice and I was off.<br> <br>The hair on Randy Erskine&#x2019;s arms was bleached blond by the sun and he kept his heavy watch, along with his wallet and wedding ring, in a purple velvet Crown Royal bag, which he stowed in his golf bag while he played. He had narrow hips that didn&#x2019;t rotate much on his backswing and a big shoulder turn. He used a Ping Pal putter, the same model used by my putting hero, Tom Watson. (Watson, so bold on the greens, made everything.) I had brought a tiny tool to clean the grooves on his irons, and that seemed to impress Randy. He played a practice round with a golfer named John Adams.<br> <br>After one practice round, I found myself sitting in the back of a camper-van set up for the week in the parking lot of the Quail Hollow Country Club. Three touring pros&#x2014;Randy, Doug Tewell, and Wayne Levi&#x2014;were the real occupants of that camper-van, but nobody was chasing me away. Wayne Levi&#x2019;s denim golf bag was parked outside, standing up on its own. A rap session, tour-style, was under way. To this day, it all seems so unlikely. A fourth pro, a lanky man named Don Pooley, came by with his wife, and Randy said, &#x201c;The Pooleys!&#x201d; It was like a golf commune.<br> <br>Randy Erskine&#x2019;s golf skill was like nothing I had ever seen, not up close. But his two-day total&#x2014;150 shots, each of them accounted for on scorecards and sworn to with his signature&#x2014;left him outside the cutline. His presence would not be needed for the Saturday and Sunday rounds. He made nothing that week, not on the greens and not in the way of a paycheck. Still, he stayed around to prepare for the thirty-six-hole U.S. Open qualifier that would be played on Monday.<br> <br>People were talking about how the United States Golf Association had essentially forced Arnold Palmer, who hadn&#x2019;t met any of the automatic eligibility requirements for the &#x2019;79 Open, to play in that qualifier. In other words, the USGA, in its hard-boiled wisdom, had not given a special exemption to the game&#x2019;s most popular and revered player, who was then chasing fifty. There were people who were offended by the way Palmer was being treated. But Palmer was registering no such complaint. He would not put himself above those who had to qualify.<br> <br>Randy allowed me to use the second bed in his Holiday Inn room that weekend. (Amazing.) When we showed up early on Monday morning at the Charlotte Country Club, we found out that Randy would be playing right behind Arnold Palmer himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; Randy said. &#x201c;We gotta play in his wake all day.&#x201d;<br> <br>I felt he was feigning frustration, and noted his use of we. Randy Erskine was a touring professional in the vicinity of Arnold Palmer. How could that be anything but good?<br> <br>There were at least a hundred people following Palmer that day, but it was never anything like bedlam. Palmer&#x2019;s hair was already silver and his skin was bronzed. Palmer made it&#x2014;he played his way into the U.S. Open. Randy did not. Still, he paid me one hundred dollars for the day. (Half that would have been generous.) He wasn&#x2019;t playing in that week&#x2019;s tournament in Atlanta. The week after that was the U.S. Open at Inverness in Toledo, Ohio, and he had just failed to qualify. But he would be playing the following week, in the Canadian Open. He said I could work for him in Canada.<br> <br>And here I was, thirty-something years later, back in Charlotte, heading to Augusta in the name of Sports Illustrated. I got myself from Wilkinson Boulevard to Billy Graham Parkway to I-77 and motored my way south. I could not identify my old motel. Maybe it was gone.<br> <br>I found myself thinking, for the first time in forever, about that long-ago Monday morning at the Charlotte Country Club, Arnold Palmer arriving in a shiny white Cadillac from a dealership that bore his name. He emerged from his grand chariot. Everybody inhaled. Time stopped. Arnold Palmer, in the flesh.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>In October 2012 the Ryder Cup was played at Medinah, outside Chicago, and my assignment for the magazine was to help Davis Love III write a deadline first-person piece about his experience as Ryder Cup captain, a task that would be fun if the Americans won and challenging if they did not. Late at night, after the first day of the three-day competition, I was in a downtown restaurant by myself at a table with a paper tablecloth, and I found myself writing names on it. The names came to me quickly. I marked one column LIVING LEGENDS, the other SECRET LEGENDS.<br> <br>LIVING LEGENDS<br> <br>Arnold Palmer<br> <br>Jack Nicklaus<br> <br>Gary Player<br> <br>Ken Venturi<br> <br>Tom Watson<br> <br>Curtis Strange<br> <br>Fred Couples<br> <br>Ben Crenshaw<br> <br>Hale Irwin<br> <br>SECRET LEGENDS<br> <br>Sandy Tatum<br> <br>Jaime Diaz<br> <br>Billy Harmon<br> <br>Neil Oxman<br> <br>Dolphus Hull (aka Golf Ball)<br> <br>Randy Erskine<br> <br>Cliff Danley<br> <br>Chuck Will<br> <br>Mike Donald<br> <br>Maybe I was subconsciously filling out lineup cards for a National League game, I don&#x2019;t know, but when I was done I had two columns with nine names each for a total of eighteen&#x2014;golf&#x2019;s holy number.<br> <br>During dessert, I decided to add Mickey Wright to the Living Legends list. The Big Three of the modern American golf swing are Ben Hogan, Tiger Woods, and Mickey Wright, and the list just didn&#x2019;t look right without her. (The first golf book I read was Power Golf by Ben Hogan, published originally in 1948. It was a hardcover, and I read it outside with a club in hand. Where my mother found it I have no idea.) When I added Mickey, I took off Gary Player, a nod to symmetry more than anything else. That move, unintentionally, made the list all-American. Seventeen American men and one American woman.<br> <br>The Living Legends were all players. The Secret Legends list included a club pro, a teaching pro, a tour caddie. A tournament director in his sixties, a TV producer in his eighties, a former USGA president in his nineties. They had all shaped my life. They all, in different ways, had driven deep stakes into the game long before I started poking around in it in the mid-1970s. Because of that, they were all elder statesmen to me&#x2014;even Fred Couples, less than six months older than I.<br> <br>Later, I got out a map and put a little check mark by each legend&#x2019;s hometown. Before long, I had red marks in Pennsylvania, Michigan, California, Texas, Virginia, Ohio, and some other states. I concocted a vague plan to try to see each of them, notebook in hand, wherever I might find them. I got a little shiver. Does anything give a man more of a sense of purpose than a list?<br> <br>My combined list had built-in problems. I didn&#x2019;t know if Golf Ball was alive or dead. Fred was impossible. (Likable but impossible.) Palmer could be a challenge to interview. Mickey Wright didn&#x2019;t even come to the USGA museum for the dedication ...</p><h2>Elfquest Book #07: Cry from Beyond</h2><p>Cutter&#39;s chosen band of elves find themselves transported to an unknown land, where they have difficulty communicating with the strange group of elves that summoned them</p><p></p><h2>Sacred Feathers: The Reverend Peter Jones (Kahkewaquonaby) and the Mississauga Indians</h2><p>Jones, Peter, -- 1802-1856.

A boy, Daniel, happens across an enormous pink slipper at the foot of a huge mango tree. He clambers in and is hoisted aloft, where he meets Mangaboom--all 19 feet and 682 pounds of her--who tells him of her favorite pastimes: skinny-dipping and turning cartwheels. Two pieces of mail arrive with Daniel: an invitation to her aunt's for tea with three bachelor giants, and a love letter from someone named Grizwaldo. He begs Mangaboom to write, but before she can retrieve his address on the envelope, her goat eats it up. Crestfallen, Mangaboom heads off with Daniel to tea, where her suitors turn out to be dreadful rubes. Happily for Mangaboom, but unhappily for any potential drama surrounding the lost address, Grizwaldo writes the next day, saying he'll drop by that evening. Daniel takes his leave, though not without getting a glimpse of Grizwaldo (who looks a great deal like a giant Daniel). On the saucily suggestive last page, it looks as though they'll go skinny-dipping that night. Snippets of Spanish give this story an exotic air, and the affection the storyteller has for her characters is evident, even though a plot is not. Lobel's gouaches give a heroic touch to the proceedings, with Mangaboom's colossalness often bleeding right off the page. (Picture book. 5+) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When General Judson, a supporter of the Dawes Allotment Act, is shot during a performance and Zane is charged with attempted murder, Rose sets out to clear his name. She suspects that the real target was Senator North, a staunch advocate for American Indian rights, and that Chief White Bear, a Dakota Indian who performs in the show, knows more than he will tell. While she receives assistance from the 13-year-old son of the Wild West Show's co-owner and clues from Chief White Bear, it is Rose herself who must solve the mystery and bring the would-be assassin to justice. While there are some historical inaccuracies, such as South Dakota called a state three years before it was admitted to the Union, the story strives to be true to the era while incorporating modern sensibilities about prejudice and racial injustice.<br><i>Farida S.

It is the third book in her five-book Canopus in Argos series and continues the story of Earth&#39;s evolution, which has been manipulated from the beginning by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1981. This book relates directly to the first book in this series, Shikasta which is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, Canopus, Sirius and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. Shikasta is told from the Canopean viewpoint. The Sirian Experiments (subtitled The Report by Ambien II, of the Five) tells the story of Shikasta from Sirius&#39;s point of view and describes their activities on the planet and their strained relations with Canopus. Lessing stated in an afterword in the next book in this series that The Sirian Experiments and The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 were inspired by her 50-year fascination with the ill-fated 1910-13 Antarctic expedition of Robert Falcon Scott.</p><p></p><h2>Sweat of the sun, tears of the moon: Gold and emerald treasures of Colombia</h2><p>Book by The Natural History Museum of Los Angele</p><p></p><h2>Writing Places: The Life Journey of a Writer and Teacher</h2><p><p>&#x201c;William Zinsser turns his zest, warmth and curiosity&#x2014;his sharp but forgiving eye&#x2014;on his own story.

Any attempt to reflect theoretically on this topic must address a host of vital questions: how to distinguish between &#x201c;insiders&#x201d; and &#x201c;outsiders&#x201d; in a normatively defensible way; how to secure for all individuals within a political society a sense of full membership in the social and political life of that society; and how to keep allegiance to the political community durable in the face of mounting pressures, domestic and international. <br><br>The need to rethink the issue of citizenship has been given special urgency by incisive theoretical challenges to liberalism within the academy as well as practical challenges associated with continuing flare-ups of modern nationalism and ethnic strife, implying challenges, both localist and globalist, to the integrity of the modern state.<br><br>Therefore, political theorists must once again explore the basic problem of what binds citizens together into a shared political community. Theoretical essays by such well- known scholars as Habermas, Walzer, Flathman, Iris Marion Young, MacIntyre, Ignatieff, and George Armstrong Kelly offer a sampling of some of the best articles on this crucial topic.</p><p><p>Ronald Beiner is Professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto.

By the author of Alien Taste. Original.</p><p>The sequel to <i>Alien Taste</i> (2001) sends Ukiah Oregon off on the trail of Alicia Kraynak, the niece of his partner Max's best friend. What appears to be an ordinary disappearance quickly turns out to involve alien invaders, the Ontongard (somewhat like the Borg of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>), and one of Ukiah's earlier selves, the feral Wild Boy of the Oregon wilderness. These contingencies immediately put Ukiah on his mettle, for he is actually the only fertile offspring of a rebel faction of the Ontongard that has been struggling for centuries to save Earth from universal infection and conversion into another conquered group-mind of the "orthodox" Ontongard. The battle against evil aliens is action-packed though relatively unsurprising, but Spencer's skillful characterizations, vividly drawn settings, and comic exploitation of Ukiah's deceptively youthful, highly buff looks make the romp high light entertainment. Fortunately, this isn't likely to be Ukiah's farewell performance. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When his mother suddenly dies, Fellworth is shocked to discover that she has left him a sizable inheritance. confused, Fell teams up with Maggie, a plain girl with a similar background, to investigate the source of the riches. But what they find is a closet full of skeletons...</p><p>Is it really possible Fell's father was involved in a long-ago train robbery? Who's the mysterious woman in the portrait hidden in his mother's wardrobe? As Maggie and Fell poke around the village for answers, they find themselves on a surprise-filled path to danger and adventure, and--just possibly--love. But Fell's sudden good fortune could come to an abrupt end if he doesn't stay one step ahead of a cunning killer... from beloved novelist M.C. Beaton comes this thrilling stand-alone mystery, <i>The Skeleton in the Closet</i>.</p></p><p>M. C. BEATON, the British guest of honor at Bouchercon 2006, is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling romance and suspense writer who has been hailed as the "Queen of Crime" (<i>The Globe and Mail</i>). She is the author of more than twenty Agatha Raisin novels, whose fans range from the actress Elizabeth Hurley to the Archbishop of Canterbury, as well as the Hamish Macbeth series. Born in Scotland, she now divides her time between Paris and the English Cotswolds.Taking a break from her two long-running series (Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth), Beaton introduces a pair of engaging misfits whose struggles to cope with overbearing families and overweening circumstances teach them, eventually, to rely on each other. When diffident fortyish virgin Fellworth Dolphin's mother dies, he finds himself surprisingly relieved and freed from a bondage he was only partially aware of. That's nowhere near the astonishment he feels when he learns that, in spite of their penurious existence, he's heir to a large sum. In a moment of panic, when it seems an aunt might assume the tyrannical role his mother once played, Fell pretends an engagement to mousy waitress Maggie Partlett. In fits and starts, Maggie and Fell begin their separate transformations--she to a swan, he to a drake. One catalyst is the money and its questionable provenance--perhaps the result of an infamous train robbery that occurred many years ago and that Fell's father might have been involved with. The other is the transformation wrought by their shared investigation and their shared lives, as Maggie falls in with the pretended engagement for her own purposes. Various relatives and villains attempt to derail the couple as they journey, but there's never a question of where the author is taking her odd couple, and never a doubt they will arrive safely. The trip will delight fans of either of Beaton's other series. (Mar. 21)will be published on Mar. 6 (see Forecasts, Dec. 18, 2000).<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Camp Adair: The Story of a World War II Cantonment Today: Oregon&#39;s Largest Ghost Town</h2><p>The story of a World War II Cantonment from its inception and history as an Army training camp.

The proud owner of a spanking-new medical degree and little else in the way of worldly possessions, Barry jumps at the chance to secure a position as an assistant in a small rural practice.At least until he meets Dr. Fingal Flahertie O&#x20ac;&#x2122;Reilly.The older physician, whose motto is to never let the patients get the upper hand, has his own way of doing things. At first, Barry can&#x20ac;&#x2122;t decide if the pugnacious O&#x20ac;&#x2122;Reilly is the biggest charlatan he has ever met, or the best teacher he could ever hope for. Through O&#x20ac;&#x2122;Reilly Barry soon gets to know all of the village&#x20ac;&#x2122;s colorful and endearing residents, including: A malingering Major and his equally hypochondriacal wife; A</p><p><p>Patrick Taylor, M.D., is the author of the Irish Country books, including <i>An Irish Country Village</i>, <i>An Irish Country Christmas</i>, <i>An Irish Country Girl</i>, and <i>An Irish Country Courtship</i>. Taylor was born and raised in Bangor County Down in Northern Ireland. After qualifying as a specialist in 1969, he worked in Canada for thirty-one years. He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.</p><p>Author&#x2019;s NoteDoctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly and the denizens of Ballybucklebo first appeared in 1995 in my monthly column in Stitches: The Journal of Medical Humour. It was suggested to me that these characters might form the foundation for a novel.I had just finished Pray for Us Sinners, and hesitating to delve once more into the misery of the Ulster Troubles, I found the idea of something lighter to be appealing. An Irish Country Doctor began to take shape.Like Only Wounded and Pray for Us Sinners, the book is set in the northeast corner of Ireland, but unlike its predecessors, which I strove to make historically accurate, this story has taken some liberties with geography and time.The setting is a fictional village, the name of which came from my high-school French teacher who, enraged by my inability to conjugate irregular verbs, yelled, &#x201c;Taylor, you&#x2019;re stupid enough to come from Ballybucklebo.&#x201d; Those of an etymological bent may wish to know what the name means. Bally (Irish, baile) is a townland&#x2014;a mediaeval geographic term encompassing a small village and the surrounding farms, Buachaill means &#x201c;boy,&#x201d; and b� is a cow. In Bailebuchaillb�, or Ballybucklebo&#x2014;the townland of the boy&#x2019;s cow&#x2014;time and place are as skewed as they are in Brigadoon.Little Irish is spoken in the North, but I have been at pains to use the Ulster dialect. It is rich and colourful, but often incomprehensible to one not from that part of the world. For those who may have some difficulty, I have taken the liberty of appending a glossary (page 345).My attention to the spoken idiom is as accurate as I can make it; however, the purist will note that in 1964, the Twelfth of July fell on a Sunday, not a Thursday, and Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s first book of poetry was not published until 1966. No salmon river called the Bucklebo flows through north County Down. The nearest is the Shimna River in the Mourne Mountains. But everything else is as accurate as extensive reading and memory permit.The rural Ulster that I have portrayed has vanished. The farms and villages still look much as they did, but the simplicity of rural life has been banished by the Troubles and the all-pervasive influence of television. The automatic respect for their learning shown to those at the top of the village hierarchy&#x2014;doctor, teacher, minister, and priest&#x2014;is a thing of the past, but men like O&#x2019;Reilly were common when I was a very junior doctor. And on that subject, may I please lay to rest a question I am frequently asked by readers of my column in Stitches? Barry Laverty and Patrick Taylor are not one and the same. Doctor F. F. O&#x2019;Reilly is a figment of my troubled mind, despite the efforts of some of my expatriate Ulster friends to see in him a respected&#x2014;if unorthodox&#x2014;medical practitioner of the time. Lady Macbeth does owe her being to our demoniacally possessed cat, Minnie, and Arthur Guinness owes his to a black Labrador, now long gone but who had an insatiable thirst for Foster&#x2019;s lager. All the other characters are composites, drawn from my imagination and from my experiences as a rural GP.Patrick Taylor1You Can&#x2019;t Get There from HereBarry Laverty&#x2014;Doctor Barry Laverty&#x2014;his houseman&#x2019;s year just finished, ink barely dry on his degree, pulled his beat-up Volkswagen Beetle to the side of the road and peered at a map lying on the passenger seat. Six Road Ends was clearly marked. He stared through the car&#x2019;s insect-splattered windscreen. Judging by the maze of narrow country roads that ran one into the other just up ahead, somewhere at the end of one of those blackthorn-hedged byways lay the village of Ballybucklebo. But which road should he take? And, he reminded himself, there was more to that question than simple geography.Most of his graduating classmates from the medical school of the Queen&#x2019;s University of Belfast had clear plans for their careers. But he hadn&#x2019;t a clue. General practice? Specialize? And if so, which speciality? Barry shrugged. He was twenty-four, single, no responsibilities. He knew he had all the time in the world to think about his medical future, but his immediate prospects might not be bright if he were late for his five o&#x2019;clock appointment, and though finding a direction for his life might be important, his most pressing need was to earn enough to pay off the loan on the car.He scowled at the map and retraced the road he had travelled from Belfast, but the Six Road Ends lay near the margin of the paper. No Ballybucklebo in sight. What to do?He looked up, and as he did he glimpsed himself in the rearview mirror. Blue eyes looked back at him from a clean-shaven oval face. His tie was askew. No matter how carefully he tied the thing, the knot always managed to wander off under one collar tip. He understood the importance of first impressions and did not want to look scruffy. He tugged the tie back into place, then tried to smooth down the cowlick on the crown of his fair hair, but up it popped. He shrugged. It would just have to stay that way. He wasn&#x2019;t going to a beauty contest&#x2014;it was his medical credentials that would be scrutinized. At least his hair was cut short, not like the style affected by that new musical group, the Beatles.One last glance at the map confirmed that it would be of no help in finding his destination. Perhaps, he thought, there would be a signpost at the junction. He got out of the vehicle, and the springs creaked. Brunhilde, as he called his car, was protesting about the weight of his worldly goods: two suitcases, one with his meagre wardrobe, the other crammed with medical texts; a doctor&#x2019;s medical bag tucked under the bonnet; and a fly rod, creel, and hip waders lying in the backseat. Not much to show for someone possessing a medical degree, he thought, but with any luck his finances would soon take a turn for the better&#x2014;if he could just find Ballybucklebo.He leant against the car door, conscious that his five-foot-eight, slightly built frame barely gave him enough height to peer over Brunhilde&#x2019;s domed roof, and even standing on tiptoe he could see no evidence of a signpost. Perhaps it was hidden behind the hedges.He walked to the junction and looked around to find a grave deficiency of signposts. Maybe Ballybucklebo&#x2019;s like Brigadoon, he thought, and only appears every hundred years. I&#x2019;d better start humming &#x201c;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&#x201d; and hope to God one of the little people shows up to give me directions.He walked back to the car in the warmth of the Ulster afternoon, breathing in the gorse&#x2019;s perfume from the little fields at either side of the road. He heard the liquid notes of a blackbird hiding in the fuchsia that grew wild in the hedgerow, the flowers drooping purple and scarlet in the summer air. Somewhere a cow lowed in basso counterpoint to the blackbird&#x2019;s treble.Barry savoured the moment. He might be unclear about what his future held, but one thing was certain. Nothing could ever persuade him that there was anywhere, anywhere at all, he would choose to live other than here in Northern Ireland.No map, no signpost, and no little people, he thought as he approached the car. I&#x2019;ll just have to pick a road and... He was pleasantly surprised to see a figure mounted on a bicycle crest the low hill and pedal sedately along the road.&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Barry stepped into the path of the oncoming cyclist. &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; The cyclist wobbled, braked, and stood, one foot on the ground and the other on a pedal. For a moment Barry wondered if his hopes of meeting a leprechaun had been fulfilled. &#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; he said.He was addressing a gangly youth, innocent face half hidden under a Paddy hat, but not hidden well enough to disguise a set of buckteeth that Barry decided would be the envy of every hare in the Six Counties. He carried a pitchfork over one shoulder and wore a black worsted waistcoat over a collarless shirt. His tweed trousers were tied at the knees with leather thongs that the locals called &#x201c;nicky tams.&#x201d;&#x201c;Grand day,&#x201d; he remarked.&#x201c;It is.&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye. Grand. Hay&#x2019;s coming along fine, so it is.&#x201d; The youth picked his nose.&#x201c;I wonder if you could help me?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye?&#x201d; The cyclist lifted his hat and scratched his ginger hair. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for Ballybucklebo.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; His brow knitted, and the head scratching increased.&#x201c;Can you tell me how to get there?&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d; He pursed his lips. &#x201c;Boys-a-boys, thon&#x2019;s a grand wee place, so it is.&#x201d;Barry tried not to let his growing exasperation show. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it is, but I have to get there by five.&#x201d;&#x201c;Five? Today, like?&#x201d;&#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; Barry bit back the words &#x201c;No. In the year 2000.&#x201d; He waited.The youth fumbled in the fob pocket of his waistcoat, produced a pocketwatch, and consulted it, frowning and muttering to himself. He looked at Barry. &#x201c;Five? You&#x2019;ve no much time left.&#x201d;&#x201c;I know that. If you could just&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Ballybucklebo?&#x201d;&#x201c;Please?&#x201d;&#x201c;Och, aye.&#x201d; He pointed to the road that lay straight ahead. &#x201c;Take that road.&#x201d;&#x201c;That one?&#x201d;&#x201c;Aye. Follow your nose &#x2019;til you come to Willy John McCoubrey&#x2019;s red barn.&#x201d;&#x201c;Red barn. Right.&#x201d;&#x201c;Now you don&#x2019;t turn there.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not at all. Keep right on. You&#x2019;ll see a black-and-white cow in a field&#x2014;unless Willy John has her in the red barn for milking. Now go past her, and take the road to your right.&#x201d; As he spoke, the youth pointed to the left side of the road.Barry felt a mite confused. &#x201c;First right past the black-and-white cow?&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her,&#x201d; he said, continuing to point to the left. &#x201c;From there on, it&#x2019;s only a wee doddle. Mind you, sir...&#x201d; He started to mount his rusty machine. Then he delivered the rest of the sentence with the solemnity of a priest givin...</p></p><h2>Jane Austen and Marriage</h2><p><p>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife." -<i>Pride and Prejudice </i></p><p>The question of marriage lies at the center of Jane Austen's novels.

Seriously, I&#x2019;m not exaggerating. It really is O-V-E-R. I feel absolutely mortified, infuriatingly pissed, and pathetically distraught. To sum it up, I am nothing less than the superstar of my own major shitshow. And to make matters even worse, this entire debacle is all over&#x2014;drumroll, please&#x2014;a boy. Yup, a freaking boy, who just twelve hours ago was the &#x201c;man&#x201d; I was engaged to marry. All because I had let him sweep me off my feet as I fell madly in love with him in the short time frame of only eight weeks. And now he&#x2019;s just another freaking boy, one who has left me utterly heartbroken.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be like this. I&#x2019;m not supposed to be like this. Not after a breakup! It isn&#x2019;t as if this is my first failed relationship. Hell, I&#x2019;ve had twenty-five in the past year alone, and that&#x2019;s not even including this one. Damn, saying that number aloud makes me cringe inside. Twenty-five, hold up, now twenty-six breakups in a year has got to be some sort of a record, right? If only we got consolation prizes for our breakups, perhaps a new pair of fabulous shoes. Then at least we could drown away our sorrows on the floor of a shoe closet worthy of Carrie Bradshaw, all the while knowing that each breakup came with three to five inches of pep-in-our-step leg-skinnifying stiletto pleasure. But no, life isn&#x2019;t that fair. At least not in my world. All I&#x2019;m left with is a slew of practice breakups, which should have prepared me for this epic one. However, as I sit here crying and drowning my sorrows with a bottle of ros� (I&#x2019;ll switch to red once the sun goes down), a pen, and this diary, even through a haze of Grenache it is crystal clear that nothing could have ever prepared me for this. Yeah, this one&#x2019;s gonna hurt.<br> <br>Fuck! How did I even end up here?<br> <br>Obviously I know the technical answer to that&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t take a genius to understand that in order to get to number twenty-six, you&#x2019;ve got to start with number one (not to be confused with &#x201c;the One&#x201d;). And of all the ways I could have met a man, somehow my way was on a reality television show. I wish I could say I&#x2019;m joking, but I&#x2019;m embarrassingly serious.<br> <br>Where do I even begin? I guess to make a long story short, this new chapter of dating on television began for me late one chilly September night in the great state of California after I&#x2019;d been flown cross-country from Atlanta to Los Angeles, where I was promptly put up in an undisclosed hotel and stripped of my phone and any other form of communication with the outside world. Seventy-two painfully boring hours later, it was finally time to meet Number One, whom I knew little about except that he had won the romantic lottery by being chosen to date thirty &#x201c;lucky&#x201d; women, all handpicked just for him. A single father with Latin heritage, he was a former athlete and looking for love. And so was I.<br> <br>The night had finally come. Doused with half a bottle of hair spray, my wavy locks had the texture of straw as I slipped into the slinky floor-length Halston Heritage gown I had purchased only days ago from the clearance rack at Loehmann&#x2019;s. I had been impatiently waiting for hours, passing the time with several reapplications of mascara and blush, when finally a producer came to my door and ushered me down in the elevator, through the hotel lobby, and into a waiting stretch limousine. Already inside were four other women, also dressed in floor-length gowns and also ready to meet Number One. I took a seat against the window and observed each woman. One had a pillow shoved in the midsection of her dress resembling a baby bump, which I found quite ballsy and slightly uncomfortable given that Number One was a single father. Another woman wore a sequined gown with a plunging neckline, while another wouldn&#x2019;t stop bragging in a high-pitched screech that she was wearing cowboy boots underneath her black gown, which had a conveniently placed cutout revealing her lower-back tattoo. The fourth woman&#x2014;the only normal one, in my opinion&#x2014;wore her hair in a sophisticated chignon that complemented her soft skin, which resembled that of a porcelain doll. A producer hopped into the limo along with a cameraman, and just like that, we were off and on our way to the circus!<br> <br>A short drive later, the limo was parked in the cobblestone driveway of an enormous Spanish-style mansion, with Number One standing amid bright lights in front of a large fountain adorned with colorful flowers. With a dozen cameras positioned at various heights and angles, he waited as one by one, each of the four other women exited the vehicle and greeted him. Each engaged in a short conversation before sashaying around the fountain and entering the arched wooden front doors of the mansion. When it was my turn, I stepped out of the limo and began what felt like the longest ten-foot walk of my life. The moment I laid eyes on Number One, I was infatuated. His satisfactorily tall athletic build, blond hair, and expensive suit that fit snugly in all the right areas (if you know what I mean) had me both nervous and intrigued. A quick introduction later, with a grin, I too sashayed around the fountain and entered the mansion.<br> <br>The setup was simple: If I survived the first night, I along with the other survivors would move into this mansion and begin &#x201c;dating&#x201d; Number One, who got to go on three dates a week with the women of his choosing; two of those would be private solo dates, while the third would be a &#x201c;group date.&#x201d; Each week, Number One got to eliminate a select number of women until it was finally down to one who, if all went according to plan, he loved enough to propose to, and the two of them would ride off into the sunset together and live happily ever after. Oh, and all of this while cameras rolled, capturing our every move.<br> <br>After surviving the first night&#x2014;which really ended at sunrise the next day&#x2014;I began what would be a seven-week romance with Number One. Each week brought a new round of dates and with it a new destination, and of course, new drama. Week after week, I found myself on these dreaded &#x201c;group dates,&#x201d; where I&#x2019;d sit back and watch the majority of the women flaunt their assets, play damsel in distress, and take every opportunity to one-up each other. Luckily, each woman also got a little private time on these dates. At first I longed for these moments where I&#x2019;d get to flirt and make out without the prying eyes of the other women, but week after week, as I continued to be bypassed for a solo date, I found the conversation becoming more and more dull. Nonetheless, week after week I stayed, partially in anticipation of getting a solo date, which I hoped would ignite a romance between us, partially because I was traveling the world for free&#x2014;but mainly because I was just so damn attracted to him. Boring conversations aside, let&#x2019;s be honest, nothing makes a woman want a good-looking man more than other women wanting him too; it&#x2019;s the basic law of human attraction. His position of power created an aura around him that made him attractive enough to justify turning a blind eye to the painfully boring conversations I endured for weeks.<br> <br>Fast-forward seven weeks, twenty-seven eliminated women later, thousands of miles traveled to incredible countries like South Korea, Vietnam, and New Zealand, and a hometown visit in which I had introduced Number One to my family, who were less than impressed, and I was still in the &#x201c;competition&#x201d; along with two other women. Our worldwide journey had brought us to our final destination, St. Lucia, and with just two weeks until the end, this week of dating was far different from the others: It was finally time to take part in what the show dubbed the &#x201c;fantasy suite dates.&#x201d; This was the moment when I&#x2019;d get to spend the night with Number One without the prying eyes of cameras or producers. This was the moment where sparks would finally be ignited.<br> <br>Ha! Yeah, right. Unless if by sparks you mean he blasted Ray Jay and R. Kelly all night long and showed me dozens of videos of his old soccer highlights on YouTube. There was no getting to know me, no romance, and there was most definitely no fantasy involved in the evening. All there was was the realization that I was nothing more than a pretty object he had no intentions of liking, let alone loving, and thus no amount of free travel was enticing enough to stay any longer. In fact, I couldn&#x2019;t wait for morning to come so I could hightail it out of the room, say goodbye to this journey, and go back home to Atlanta.<br> <br>The following morning, when I tried to explain the disappointment of the night, his disinterest in anything but himself became even more apparent. Delusional, like most men, he insisted everything was just peachy fucking keen, and all he would say, no matter how hard I tried to explain my point of view, was, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Throughout the show he&#x2019;d used this phrase so many times and in so many serious moments with each and every woman that it had gone from a running joke to a disrespectful annoyance. It was as if those two little words were Number One&#x2019;s way of saying, &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t care.&#x201d; And now, here he was doing the same thing to me, yet again. Everything I said was met with the same gag-worthy response. I told him I didn&#x2019;t think we were compatible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;it&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; That he didn&#x2019;t seem interested in knowing me on a deeper level&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;it&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; That it was rude to bring up the fact that he had indulged in an overnight date with another woman two days before our own&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;it&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; To make matters worse, in the middle of my rant, he actually had the audacity to wipe something off my face! I shit you not! After about six &#x201c;it&#x2019;s okays,&#x201d; I lost it.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not okay!&#x201d; I screamed. &#x201c;Everything isn&#x2019;t always okay. Feel something! Respond to something! For the love of God, say anything other than &#x2018;It&#x2019;s okay!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>But all he could say was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you guessed it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eight weeks of wasted anticipation and painstakingly boring conversations, along with resisting that extra glass of wine so I could fit into skin-tight cocktail dresses and brutalizing my feet in high heels night after night. Eight weeks of missing my family in the hopes of finding love, and it all came to an end in one maddening conversation under the blistering sun of St. Lucia. All I could do was walk away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. irritated, pissed off, and over it all. Ironically, it was this combination of animosity and the liberation I felt at recognizing and dumping a textbook chauvinist pig that provided a clean break. My heartache was minimal and short-lived, and I left St. Lucia single and ready to put the entire journey behind me.<br> <br>Little did I know that the ending of this relationship&#x2014;if you can even call it that&#x2014;would serve as the catalyst for my next twenty-five relationships and, consequently, breakups. That&#x2019;s because, apparently, dumping the show&#x2019;s lead was groundbreaking in the world of reality television, and honesty was refreshingly inspiring to viewers&#x2014;so much so that I was asked to return for a second shot at love, only this time I would be the lone woman courted and fought over by a sea of hunky men. As irresistible as it sounded, I grappled with the thought of interrupting my life once again to partake in a second shitshow. I had been there, done that, and checked &#x201c;dating on reality television&#x201d; off my bucket list, but the hopeless romantic in me was still searching for love.<br> <br>After debating for weeks, I reluctantly decided to throw my hands in the air, let Jesus take the wheel, and give love another shot. You&#x2019;d have thought I&#x2019;d learned my lesson the first go-round, but an unusual optimism told me this second time was going to be different. I don&#x2019;t know what it was, but I just felt it. It was as if all the stars in my world had aligned, and I was about to meet my soul mate and live happily every after.<br> <br>So three months after saying goodbye to Mr. It&#x2019;s Okay, I was back in Los Angeles, standing in front of that same gaudy mansion, surrounded by cameras ready to capture my every move as I began &#x201c;dating&#x201d; twenty-five men. The next eight weeks were going to be the most intense, emotional, and fun of my life, surrounded by hot men and cameras. However, since polygamy is illegal (and gross), I couldn&#x2019;t keep them all, and unfortunately each week I had to break up with one hot stud after another. (So unfair!)<br> <br>Although each of the breakups came with a different story and different emotions, they seemed so much more amicable than my previous breakup with Number One. The earlier breakups were easier, considering I&#x2019;d barely known the men long enough to be told their last names. But as the weeks went on, I found that the worst moments throughout the show weren&#x2019;t the hours of exhaustion or the times I felt homesick or overcome with anxiety before a date, but rather when I had to say goodbye to yet another nice guy. The fact that I was standing five feet away from someone I knew I was moments away from dumping was awkward enough, but the guilt I felt afterward was torment. There was a control that came with being the one deciding who went home and when, a power that normally I would have loved to possess, but had quickly turned into a burden I couldn&#x2019;t wait to shed. I found myself wondering, Why me? Who had given me the right to dump good, kindhearted men who had put their lives on hold, risked humiliation and heartbreak, and treated me with nothing but respect? Who had made me the judge in this case? Half of the men I dumped were probably too good for me anyway, and yet somehow, by breaking up with them, I felt like I was minimizing them. It got harder as, week after week, deeper relationships formed and I wondered, &#x201c;Would they be brokenhearted? Was I about to ruin their lives?&#x201d;<br> <br>And now here I am, the one not all right. The one brokenhearted. The biggest and hardest breakup of them all is without question Number Twenty-Six. This is going to be one of those breakups that will define me for the rest of my life, haunt me wherever I go, a permanent skeleton in my closet. Not only is the entire world going to know about it, thanks to the making of this entire relationship being broadcast to millions, but this blunder will be the ultimate &#x201c;I told you so&#x201d; from every single viewer of the show. I&#x2019;ll have gone from being a successful attorney to a reality television star to the laughingstock of the nation. I&#x2019;ll be seen as just another woman who &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t keep a man.&#x201d; And if the devastation and embarrassment of that aren&#x2019;t enough to set this breakup far apart from the first twenty-five, it will also brand me with a label I&#x2019;ll have to wear forever. It won&#x2019;t be a Prada or Dior label; no, this will be more like a cheap knockoff you get on the streets of Chinatown. In all my years and fashion faux pas (of which there are plenty), this is the worst label I have ever worn, and it&#x2019;s called&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ex-fianc�e.<br> <br>Because that&#x2019;s the label you get when you fall in love, get engaged, and it doesn&#x2019;t work out. You can&#x2019;t cut it out, sell it on eBay or pretend it&#x2019;s not yours. No, this one belongs to you forever. You now get the privilege of telling people&#x2014;what do they call it these days?&#x2014;oh yes, that you have been &#x201c;previously engaged.&#x201d; How delightful...</p><h2>The Projective Arc: Guru Visions and Theological Tethering</h2><p>What Faqir has discovered is that religious visions, no matter how profound or uplifting, are self generated and are not due to the miraculous energies of a saint or an esteemed master. Yet, disciples worldwide tend to believe otherwise and thereby project power and omniscience on their respective gurus who, in truth, have neither. Therein lies the great religious trap. An unscrupulous guru is akin to a parasitic vampire who psychically lives off the deepest yearnings and sincerest intentions of their devotees, never letting on that they are completely devoid of power. What power a guru gets is entirely due to the faith and devotion of their following, but seldom do they reveal this fact. Faqir repeatedly rallies against this deception and consistently tells all who will listen that he is completely unaware of appearing to anyone in their dreams, meditation, or near-death experiences. He wants spiritual seekers to know the truth that all such visions are manifestations of their own mind and that to be truly liberated one has to recognize these projections as one&#39;s own and transcend them. Otherwise one is deceived by maya and entrapped in an endless cycle of samsara. No guru in the history of Radhasoami has told the truth in such stark terms as has Faqir Chand. It is for this reason that Faqir is just as relevant today as he was in the 20th century, if not even more so. This book contains excerpts from Faqir Chand describing the true nature behind religious visions and miracles. Also included are several prefatory essays explaining how the projective arc and religious tethering actually work.</p><p>David Christopher Lane, Ph.D., is a Professor of Philosophy at Mt.

Then they discover Easy Pets, a convenient dog-rental agency. Terrier Fleck arrives on Hal&#39;s birthday, but when Hal discovers that his dog must be returned, he runs away. Hal and Fleck are joined by a group of pedigree breeds joyfully escaping from Easy Pets - among them is Otto, the wise and somber St Bernard, and the fierce and exactable Pekinese Li-Chee. A large reward is offered for the missing boy, and soon Hal and his dogs are being chased across the country by ruthless pursuers. Helped by a travelling circus, and the sympathetic children from an orphanage, they race for their freedom in a classic adventure in the tradition of &#34;101 Dalmatians&#34;.

Often and often when you wanted something and then got it, it was a disappointment. But having a dog was completely different. He'd wanted it and wanted it and when it happened, it was even better than he'd thought it would be. He'd imagined some of it-the companionship and the warmth-but he didn't realize a dog would make you laugh so much, or that he would help you to make so many friends. <br>It was extraordinary too how much a dog made you see. The hollows in the oak tree . . . and the way the acorns sat so neatly in their cups . . . how the earth clagged together, so dark after rain. . . Hal hadn't even noticed that it had rained. <br>And how much he made you think. Fleck had found an iron grating over a drain when they went out in the afternoon. The drain had interested him so much that he'd lain down on his stomach, just looking and smelling and investigating, and Hal realized that he'd never before thought about what might live down there, in the black and evil-looking water. <br>Hal reached up to turn on his night-light, but Fleck was lying across his feet and Hal didn't want to disturb him. Anyway, he didn't need a night-light now; he had a protector and a friend.</i></p><h2>Cowcumbers, Pipplewaks and Altigatorsbook 2 (Nelly the Monster Sitter)</h2><p>Nelly&#39;s phone is still ringing with lots more monster sitting requests.

He is one of the great figures of the First World War, and Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man and Memoirs of an Infantry Officer are still widely read, as are his poems, which did much to shape our present ideas about the Great War. Sassoon was a genuine hero, a brave young officer who also became the war&#39;s most famous opponent, risking imprisonment and even a death sentence by throwing his Military Cross into the Mersey. He was friend to Robert Graves, mentor to Wilfred Owen and much admired by Churchill. But Sassoon was more than the embodiment of a romantic ideal; he was in many senses the perfect product of a vanished age.

There he discovers a dangerous atmosphere, with tensions running high between the political Islamists and the &#39;enlightened, pro-Western&#39; Turkish military. The second half of the novel takes place over a three-day period. Following the set-piece military coup, Pamuk brilliantly explores such themes as politics, love, ethics, religion and poetry, as we gradually discover the real truth concerning the poet and the snow covered old-world city of Kars.</p><p>Dread, yearning, identity, intrigue, the lethal chemistry between secular doubt and Islamic fanaticism-these are the elements that Orhan Pamuk anneals in this masterful, disquieting novel. An exiled poet named Ka returns to Turkey and travels to the forlorn city of Kars. His ostensible purpose is to report on a wave of suicides among religious girls forbidden to wear their head-scarves. But Ka is also drawn by his memories of the radiant Ipek, now recently divorced. <br>Amid blanketing snowfall and universal suspicion, Ka finds himself pursued by figures ranging from Ipek's ex-husband to a charismatic terrorist.

They've been around since before the Civil War and for much of that time almost all fly rods - cheap, expensive, and in between - were made of split bamboo.

Kendall Walton presents here a theory of the nature of representation, which illuminates its many varieties and goes a long way toward explaining its importance. Drawing analogies to children&#x2019;s make believe activities, Walton constructs a theory that addresses a broad range of issues: the distinction between fiction and nonfiction, how depiction differs from description, the notion of points of view in the arts, and what it means for one work to be more &#x201c;realistic&#x201d; than another. He explores the relation between appreciation and criticism, the character of emotional reactions to literary and visual representations, and what it means to be caught up emotionally in imaginary events.</p><p>Walton&#x2019;s theory also provides solutions to the thorny philosophical problems of the existence&#x2015;or ontological standing&#x2015;of fictitious beings, and the meaning of statements referring to them. And it leads to striking insights concerning imagination, dreams, nonliteral uses of language, and the status of legends and myths.</p><p>Throughout Walton applies his theoretical perspective to particular cases; his analysis is illustrated by a rich array of examples drawn from literature, painting, sculpture, theater, and film. <i>Mimesis as Make-Believe</i> is important reading for everyone interested in the workings of representational art.</p></p><p>Kendall L.

But before the explorers even crack a whip, they receive a desperate mayday call from an Inuit family that is stranded in the far north. Suddenly, Gannon and Wyatt's expedition to study climate change and Greenlandic culture turns into something far more dangerous--a mission to save lives. As they rush north to rescue the family, led by Inuit guides, the brothers must steer clear of deadly hidden crevasses, hungry polar bears, and bitter cold as they race into an Arctic super-storm, putting even more lives in jeopardy--their own. <p> In the tradition of the historic journals kept by explorers such as Lewis and Clark, Dr. David Livingstone, and Captain James Cook comes the adventure series <i>Travels with Gannon and Wyatt</i>.

What was meant to be a purely educational experience turns into a rescue mission when they learn about several Inuit families whose dogs have been stricken with a mysterious illness, leaving them stranded and starving in the far north. Despite having experienced guides with them, Gannon and Wyatt's journey is filled with dangers: a hungry polar bear, cracking ice, and treacherous crevasses. But it is a blinding sudden storm that proves to be the most deadly challenge of all, leaving Wyatt alone in the raging blizzard with no food or supplies. Told in journal entries alternating between the two brothers, this is a gripping and informative novel featuring the land and culture of Greenland. The characters are distinct: Wyatt is serious and analytical, interested in the climate and landscape, while Gannon is more free-spirited and drawn to the stories of the native Greenlanders. Black-and-white photos depict some of the sights the brothers describe along the way. The story takes a tragic turn in the end, when one of the guides sets out through the storm to rescue Wyatt, but there are funny moments (including some fart jokes) to lighten the tone throughout.

Before going toYale he was Professor of Philosophy at Calvin College inGrand Rapids, Michigan, for thirty years.Starred Review. This thoughtful, passionate essay collection from seasoned philosopher and theologian Wolterstorff, written over a 50-year period, ranges in topic from worship, liturgy, church architecture, music, lament, and women&#x2122;s ordination to the spiritual health of institutions including churches, colleges, businesses, and government. An overarching theme runs through: &#x153;God loves justice, not retributive justice, but that which creates a merciful, holy community where human rights are honored and every member flourishes. Several essays address formative experiences with Christians challenging injustice in South Africa, Honduras, and Palestine; Wolterstorff documents his awakening to oppression and his subsequent call to speak up on behalf of those communities. Through a Reformed Tradition lens, Wolterstorff&#x2122;s intellectually rigorous reflections encompass church fathers, reformers, and liberation theologians. American Christians who promote the &#x153;prosperity gospel and sanction torture elicit his strong condemnation. Opening and closing biographical essays address the author&#x2122;s lifelong involvement with academia, including his student and professorial years at Calvin College, Yale and Harvard; and the loss of his adult son, which inspired profound reflections on lament. An afterword contains two recent interviews that synthesize themes presented in this masterful work. (Jan.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Known as the father of science fiction, he was also a prolific writer in other genres, including contemporary novels, history, and social commentary. As a spokesman for progress and peace, his middle period novels (1900-1920) were more realistic and covered lower-middle-class life, suffrage, and the emergence of feminist ideals that pushed against the limits set by male-dominated society.</p></p><h2>The Last Launch: Messages in the Bottle</h2><p><p></p><p>Yi-Fu Tuan, one of the world&#x2019;s most honored scholars and the founder of humanist geography, has spent a lifetime exploring the relationship between the places and spaces that surround us and the inner self. In particular, his writings have focused on what it means to achieve human dignity within the varied communities we create.</p> <p>Although we humans by nature may be flawed, as evidenced by war and injustice and environmental destruction, Professor Tuan affirms that all of us, by virtue of our remarkable senses and even more remarkable minds, are able to savor the wonders of our earthly home as no other species can. Moreover, we humans are by nature moral beings. For this reason, we find true fulfillment and ultimate happiness by doing good, an emptying of the self in service to others that, paradoxically, enriches and extends the self as few other acts can.</p> <p>In <i>The Last Launch,</i> Professor Tuan&#x2019;s final book, we are given a senior scholar&#x2019;s views on a vast and complicated array of topics that would seem to require volumes to explore. But although his essays are expressed straightforwardly, they succeed in conveying big ideas&#x2015;especially to the often impatient yet deeply curious young at heart, whatever their age. And it is to them that these short messages in the bottle, tossed hopefully into the sea, are addressed. Who knows what hearts and minds they may stir to life?</p> <p></p><p></p><p>Distributed for George F.

Tuan's concluding section of 'favorites' alone holds abundant gems from a master scholar who now shares, for the last time in an illustrious career, a lifetime of erudition and teaching. Tuan's work welcomes readers to gather their own religious and ethical/philosophical foundations that can serve as building-blocks for their own faith and direction, especially in relation to the communities and larger world in which they live, learn, and grow.

Written with the verve and global embrace of personal experience that readers have come to expect from this intellectual maverick, each chapter is a gift and, indeed, like a message in the bottle: pages clipped from the mind of geography's most creative thinker, carefully encased in elegant prose, and then cast away in search of people who are curious and interested in seeing and knowing the world in a detailed, subtle, and wondrous light."</p><h2>The Tricks and Secrets of Old Time Machinists, Vol 5</h2><p>96 pages.

The book could be read at as an entertaining, straightforward guide to London&#x2019;s public conveniences but yet to our more skeptical eye it is patently a guide to where men could meet like-minded men in an era when homosexuality was illegal.

One of the world&#39;s foremost Bible experts, Dr. Greenberg&#39;s viewpoint has been shaped by the study of the ancient Near Eastern context of biblical Israel and the history of the interpretation of the Bible from its earliest translations until today. He regards the text with admiration for its enduring power, for the features that set it apart from the literatures of surrounding cultures, and for the riches discovered in it through the ages by &#34;faith-full&#34; interpreters. For Dr. Greenberg, the Jewish Bible scholar is, ultimately, charged with the task of identifying and explaining the impact that Hebrew scriptures have had on humanity in general and on Judaism in particular. These essays, composed during a period of some forty-five years, are presented essentially in their original form, many with newly added notes by the author; some of the essays have never before been published.</p><h2>The Pilot and the Little Prince</h2><p>Pilot and the Little Prince</p><p>Born in Czechoslovakia in 1949, Peter Sis is an internationally renowned author and illustrator of many books for children.

In the 1940s, Huncke befriended the young William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg, guiding them through New York's underground and introducing them to a world of volatile experience they had never imagined. His ability to relate his life story in pared-down, unaffected prose inspired them to create a new type of literature. <p>Herbert Huncke was born in 1915, in Greenfield, Massachusetts. He died in New York City on August 8, 1996.</p>Petty thief, drug addict, and Times Square hustler, Huncke (Guilty of Everything, LJ 4/1/90) led the writers of the Beat Generation from the rarefied halls of Columbia University to an exciting world of sex, drugs, and crime. He appears as a character in several Beat works including Jack Kerouac's On the Road, Allen Ginsberg's Howl, and William Burroughs's Junkie. Huncke lacked in formal education but was nonetheless charming and articulate, a gifted storyteller. Encouraged by Ginsberg and others, he published several books, including Huncke's Journal (1965) and The Evening Sun Turned Crimson (1980). This posthumously published collection reprints these two titles, long unavailable, and includes excerpts from Huncke's autobiography, as well as previously unpublished stories and letters.

The Cazalet Chronicles &#34;The Light Years&#34;, &#34;Marking Time&#34;, &#34;Confusion&#34;, &#34;Casting Off&#34;, and &#34;All Change&#34; have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and most recently for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 she was appointed commander to the Order of the British Empire.A perfect if inauspicious title for this second course of Howard's Cazalet Chronicles (begun with The Light Years, 1990), since this latest is all idling before something big happens--as the Cazalet writer-to-be, Clary, puts it, ``We need people to be in love with....We'll just have to wait.'' The waiting begins right after Chamberlain's ``peace with honor'' falls through and Hitler marches into Poland. At the Sussex manse of ``Brig'' Cazalet--now a blind old duffer shepherded around by his faithful spinster daughter, Rachel--the much extended Cazalet family gathers with their gas masks, not to mention orphaned babies (one of Rachel's charity), wounded soldiers, and London evacuees. The Brig's eldest son, Hugh, lamed during the Great War, stays at home to blunder along with the family timber firm and to coddle his wife, Sybil, who has incurable cancer; middle son, Edward, the womanizer, joins up, spending weekend leaves sexually abusing his beautifully budding daughter, Louise, while his wife, Villy, develops a crush on a conductor; and the last son, Rupert, goes missing in action right before his young wife, Zoe, has a baby. In addition, Howard focuses on the children of this crew, including: 17-year-old Louise, who attends acting school; Clary, Rupert's daughter by his late first wife, who nicely copes with her airheaded stepmother and fills her journal feverishly; and Polly, whose chief attribute is her goodness. By the end, Japan has drawn the US into the war; there's word of Rupert, possible romance for Clary, and as always, the Cazalets marching ever on.

Dating to the first century B.C., the &#34;Ten Books on Architecture&#34; are not only an excellent historical reference into ancient construction methods and aesthetics but also a manual providing much that can be applied to modern architecture. Today&#39;s architect will find much of interest in this fully illustrated reproduction of the 1914 edition translated by Morris Hicky Morgan.</p><p>Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (late 1st century B.C.), was a Roman military architect and engineer, and an expert in ballistic machines in particular. Robert Tavernor studied architecture in London, Rome and Cambridge and practices as a consultant architect. He was professor of Architecture at the universities of Edinburgh and Bath, and is currently Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

She met many shepherds while visiting the Tejon ranches of Edward Beale and Henry Miller and cultivated relationships with men others often thought of as ignorant, unambitious, and dirty, listening closely to their stories. Her neighbors were scandalized, but Austin respected the shepherds&#39; ways of thinking. In The Flock she captures their way of life, not as part of a romantic bygone era, but as exemplifying potentially radical ways of living in and thinking about the world. She blends natural history, politics, and allegory in a genre-blurring narrative championing local shepherds in their losing battle against the quickly developing tourist business in the Western Sierra.</p><p>Mary Austin&nbsp;(1868-1934) wrote more than 30 books during her career, including&nbsp;<i>Land of Little Rain</i>(1903) and&nbsp;<i>Lost Borders&nbsp;</i>(1909). Born in Carlinsville, Illinois, Mary Austin eventually ventured west with her brother and widowed mother to homestead in California. Throughout her essays, poems, plays, and stories, she focused on environmental issues and the relationship between individual experience and cultural histories.&#x201c;<i>The Flock</i>&nbsp;is not about Austin, and yet we have such a strong sense of personal presence, in her voice and style, that we are made to think about the way a mind comes to understand and be changed by listening to the stories of &#x2018;others&#x2019; and retelling them.

His contribution to an expansion of the medium of painting has informed an entire generation of contemporary painters. In his pictures and installations, Michel Majerus explored all formats, from the smallest to the overwhelmingly large. On the level of content, he quotes from comics, media, advertising, and time and again also from an arthistorical repertoire ranging from Minimal to Pop Art. The exhibition at the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart is accompanied by a catalog that outlines the various phases of his artistic development, embeds Majerus&#x2019;s oeuvre in a larger arthistorical context, and analyzes his art against the backdrop of a global flood of images.

It puts our millennial excesses in perspective to learn that the Russian empress Catherine the Great bought Old Master paintings at the rate of one every other day from 1762 to 1772, tapering down to one or two a week for the next couple of decades. Catherine dubbed her royal digs the "hermitage," or retreat, "where she could forget her rank and relax," writes Norman. (One of Catherine's rules: Visitors "shall be joyful but shall not try to damage, break, or gnaw at anything.") The empress was "gluttonous"--her own word--in her acquisition of art, buying 4,000 paintings, massive amounts of classical sculptures, porcelains and other decorative arts, the stray Michelangelo marble or two, and a national treasury's worth of engraved gems. Plus 38,000 books, not to mention four roomfulls of prints. And that's just <i>part</i> of the collection. Reading Norman's well-crafted tale of the great museum, a reader absorbs vast amounts of history and fiscal detail, while turning pages through machine-gun fire, lovers' trysts, clandestine international negotiations, and other thrills. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i>The controlled and focused style that served Norman in her previous books, such as Biedermeier Paintings, works well in her compact history of the great St. Petersburg museum. From its origin as the fashionable pavilion where Catherine the Great hung her paintings, the Hermitage grew through the 19th century until it was nationalized by the state after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Norman, who is a former art market correspondent for the Independent, does not divorce the institution from the political culture around it. Nor could she, when Stalin, desperate for foreign currency, would sell several thousand items from the Hermitage in the late 1920s. Norman is suitably aghast that this has aroused more complaint than the dictator's execution or imprisonment of at least 50 staff members a few years later. To these situations and others?such as the siege of Leningrad during WWII, when the staff living in the Hermitage ate furniture glue to survive?this book proves itself an effective and articulate guide. Although Norman explains how the Soviet Union used the museum's archeological activities to bolster its Marxist ideology, she is less clear on the museum's future in Russia's current free market. Still, this study is an achievement because it remains so readable, despite the encyclopedic march of facts. Its nearly 60 illustrations reproduce works from the collection as well as photographs of the staff and the museum; an appendix contains brief biographies of the employees who were prosecuted in the Stalinist purges. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Debrett&#39;s Peerage and Baronetage 1985.</h2><p>Book by (ed.)

The novel follows Harley, the eponymous &#x201c;man of feeling&#x201d; and impoverished aristocrat, as he travels from his rural estate to London and back in a reluctant quest for financial advancement and more heartfelt quest for kindred spirits. In addition to presenting a remarkable gallery of characters, Harley&#x2019;s story gives a profound sense of the historical changes transforming the economy, landscape, and social relations of eighteenth-century England and Scotland. </p> <p> This Broadview edition&#x2019;s critical introduction and rich selection of appendices situate <em>The Man of Feeling</em> in the context of the period&#x2019;s intellectual debates on sentiment, sympathy, and the novel. Contextual documents include contemporary reviews of the novel, selections from Mackenzie&#x2019;s correspondence and journalism, and related contemporary writings by David Hume, Adam Smith, Sir Walter Scott, and Laurence Sterne. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Maureen Harkin</strong> is an Associate Professor of English and Humanities at Reed College, Portland, Oregon. She specializes in eighteenth-century literature, particularly the sentimental novel. </p><p> &#x201c;This is a very welcome and splendidly prepared edition of a text central to European culture in the revolutionary age, and it provides a rich, accessible, and comprehensive context for understanding a hugely popular work that has been strangely neglected in the English curriculum. This edition should return this classic of sentimental literature to the mainstream of English literature.&#x201d; &#x2015; Barbara M. Benedict, Trinity College, Connecticut </p> <p> &#x201c;Broadview Press&#x2019;s new edition of <em>The Man of Feeling</em> should now be regarded as the definitive edition of Mackenzie&#x2019;s genre-defining work. The notes on the text are clear and ample without being intrusive. The supplemental materials are perfectly chosen. And Maureen Harkin&#x2019;s introduction places Mackenzie&#x2019;s work in the context of the sentimental mode deftly and efficiently, emphasizing the cultural and literary complexities of the sentimentalism that Mackenzie&#x2019;s novel typifies. The edition should be extremely useful for students at all levels, as well as for general readers.&#x201d; &#x2015; Elizabeth Hedrick, University of Texas at Austin </p> <p> &#x201c;It is useful to have a crisp new paperback edition of Henry Mackenzie&#x2019;s <em>The Man of Feeling</em>, considered by many scholars to be one of the high points of sentimental literature. The utility is increased considerably by the addition of a rich variety of appendices that supplement the text and provide valuable insights into eighteenth-century sentimentalism. All this will help readers to place this important novel in its eighteenth-century context.&#x201d; &#x2015; <em>Eighteenth-Century Scotland</em> </p></p><h2>Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s face it: Setbacks happen, and failure is always a possibility. But here&#x2019;s the good news: Amazing success has been achieved by people who once fell flat on their faces. The secret lies in how we respond to life&#x2019;s bumps and pot holes and unwelcome detours&#x2014;from getting fired or losing a business to enduring a professional rejection or pursuing a passion that fails to pan out. Misfortune, it turns out, can be a springboard to success.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Rebounders, U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> journalist Rick Newman examines the rise and fall&#x2014;and rise again&#x2014;of some of our most prolific and productive figures in order to demystify the anatomy of resilience. He identifies nine key traits found in people who bounce back that can transform a setback into the first step toward great accomplishment. Newman turns many well-worn axioms on their head as he shows how virtually anybody can improve their resilience and get better at turning adversity into personal and professional achievement.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>� Setbacks can be a secret weapon: </b>They often teach vital things you&#x2019;ll never learn in school, on the job, or from others.<br> <b>� There are smart ways to fail: </b>Once familiar with them, you&#x2019;ll be more comfortable taking risks and less discouraged if they don&#x2019;t pan out.<br> <b>� &#x201c;Defensive pessimism&#x201d; trumps optimism:</b> Planning for what could go wrong is often the best way to ensure that it doesn&#x2019;t.<br> <b>� Know when to quit:</b> Walking away at the right time can free the resources you need to exploit better opportunities.<br> <b>� &#x201c;Own the suck&#x201d;</b>: When faced with true hardship, taking command of the pain and sorrow&#x2014;rather than letting it command you&#x2014;lays the groundwork for ultimately rising above it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each lesson is highlighted by candid and inspiring stories from notable people, including musician Lucinda Williams, tennis champ James Blake, inventor Thomas Edison, army veteran and double-amputee Tammy Duckworth, and Joe Torre, former manager of the New York Yankees.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this uncertain and unstable time, <i>Rebounders</i> lays out the new rules for success and equips you with the tools you need to get ahead and thrive.</p><p><strong>A Conversation with Author Rick Newman</strong> <br> <strong>Q: Why is resilience important in today&#x2019;s Darwinian economy?</strong><br> A: A lot of people are going to have a harder time getting ahead. It&#x2019;s not necessarily their fault. Powerful forces such as globalization and the digital revolution are rapidly transforming the economy in ways we don&#x2019;t completely understand yet. Here&#x2019;s what we do know: Many of the old rules no longer apply, and there will be new classes of winners and losers. Better resilience allows people to recover faster from setbacks and stay confident while taking risks. It helps you become bold, without being reckless. It&#x2019;s just the kind of edge people need today. <p><strong>Q: What is the science behind resilience?</strong><br> A: We develop resilience the way we develop athletic or academic skills: By practicing and getting better at it. Here&#x2019;s the catch: Most people don&#x2019;t want to fail, and parents in particular don&#x2019;t want their kids to fail. So we&#x2019;re programmed to avoid failure. To some extent, that&#x2019;s a mistake. The good news, if you will, is that some sort of failure is inevitable for most people. So when it happens, it&#x2019;s important to acknowledge it and learn from it. Researchers think of this in terms of building blocks: Learning how to recover from small setbacks, even as children, helps us build the reflexes and durability that will allow us to overcome bigger setbacks in the future. The vital thing is to recognize failure as a learning opportunity and not hide it, deny it or pretend it didn&#x2019;t happen.</p> <p><strong>Q: What are some examples of people who have turned setbacks into success?</strong><br> A: One of the things I discovered while writing this book is that many successful people have endured some kind of significant failure. These crucible moments often provide insights that open the door to success later on. Many of the titans we consider landmark Americans, such as Ben Franklin, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, experienced serious setbacks along the way. They became indomitable because they learned how to stumble and recover.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s not just a historical phenomenon. In the book, I profile a dozen contemporary Americans whose failures helped make them successful. Tim Westergren was a burned-out musician when he got the idea for the Pandora Internet radio site, and realized it might be a way for struggling bands like the one he had been in to connect with new listeners they wouldn&#x2019;t find any other way. As a player early in his baseball career, Joe Torre struggled with weak confidence and a raft of personal problems. But that later gave him a unique ability to manage the complex personalities on a team like the New York Yankees (not to mention the combative owner, George Steinbrenner), and turn them into world champions. Many of the people we envy and admire are far more familiar with failure than you&#x2019;d ever guess.</p> <p><strong>Q: What are some modern misconceptions of success?</strong><br> A: There&#x2019;s a familiar slogan, &#x201c;failure is not an option.&#x201d; But that&#x2019;s for amateurs; true achievers know that failure is often an option if you&#x2019;re trying to do something difficult. Here&#x2019;s another one: &#x201c;Follow your bliss,&#x201d; popularized by the mythologist Joseph Campbell and millions of baby boomers who sort of misunderstood what he was saying. Baby boomers made it trendy to seek passion in your career. Sounds great, but many people have followed their passion straight into a career dead-end because they didn&#x2019;t think about what might go wrong. Passion alone usually isn&#x2019;t enough.</p> <p>You often hear people talk about optimism as if simply looking on the sunny side will lead to riches. But optimism can be dangerous if it leads to a blind belief that things will work out with no need for extra effort. Resilient people believe they have the power to make their lives better, but they believe that because they&#x2019;ve learned how to anticipate what could go wrong and developed &#x201c;rebounding&#x201d; skills they can summon when they need to. They&#x2019;re not blind-sided by setbacks. Anticipating them helps surmount them. The best optimism comes from gaining experience at bouncing back.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is an American renaissance possible?</strong><br> A: Many Americans feel a frustrating sense of decline, which I think is legitimate. I also think it&#x2019;s reversible&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s going to take a newfound self-sufficiency to turn things around. New government policies won&#x2019;t do it. Traditional safety nets will probably get weaker, not stronger. Anybody waiting for somebody else to solve his/her problems will be waiting a long time. But people who learn to channel the bootstrap ruggedness of the nation&#x2019;s great achievers still face a very promising future. And self-sufficiency is a core virtue possessed by Rebounders. That&#x2019;s why Rebounders will be the vanguard of the American renaissance.</p> <p></p><b>Rick Newman</b> is chief business correspondent for <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> as well as a frequent commentator on MSNBC, CNN, Fox, NPR, and other TV and radio networks.

Every site has been chosen either for diversity and volume of bird life, or for its unique and rare birds. All sites are easily accessible and open to the public year-round. Whether you are an avid birder looking for specific birds, or a casual nature enthusiast with an interest in seeing different kinds of birds, this guide will provide you with everything you need to make every birding experience a success. <p>Author Robert tougias presents a "habitat" approach to birding, showing how to use the awareness of habitat to find birds. With mountains, meadows, rivers, and reservoirs, a wide variety of habitats exists in western Massachusetts--from sub-alpine conditions to pitch pine scrubland. Within each habitat, a unique set of birds can be found. And what a variety! There are over 100 different birds nesting in western Massachusetts, and as many as 300 different birds are recorded annually through the seasons. Few people realize the ideal situation of such a large variety of birds, together with a large number of easily accessible places in which to view them. It is a winning combination for every birder at every level to enjoy. This guide allows you to seize this opportunity in an easy, userfriendly way. </p><p>Birding Western Massachusetts is written in a readable style that motivates the reader and helps ensure a productive birding day afield.

We&#x2019;re told that to be great is to be bold, to be happy is to be sociable. We see ourselves as a nation of extroverts&#x2014;which means that we&#x2019;ve lost sight of who we really are. Depending on which study you consult, one third to one half of Americans are introverts&#x2014;in other words, <i>one out of every two or three people you know</i>. (Given that the United States is among the most extroverted of nations, the number must be at least as high in other parts of the world.) If you&#x2019;re not an introvert yourself, you are surely raising, managing, married to, or coupled with one.<br><br>If these statistics surprise you, that&#x2019;s probably because so many people pretend to be extroverts. Closet introverts pass undetected on playgrounds, in high school locker rooms, and in the corridors of corporate America. Some fool even themselves, until some life event&#x2014;a layoff, an empty nest, an inheritance that frees them to spend time as they like&#x2014; jolts them into taking stock of their true natures. You have only to raise the subject of this book with your friends and acquaintances to find that the most unlikely people consider themselves introverts. <br><br>It makes sense that so many introverts hide even from themselves. We live with a value system that I call the Extrovert Ideal&#x2014;the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight. The archetypal extrovert prefers action to contemplation, risk- taking to heed-taking, certainty to doubt. He favors quick decisions, even at the risk of being wrong. She works well in teams and socializes in groups. We like to think that we value individuality, but all too often we admire one <i>type </i>of individual&#x2014;the kind who&#x2019;s comfortable &#x201c;putting himself out there.&#x201d; Sure, we allow technologically gifted loners who launch companies in garages to have any personality they please, but they are the exceptions, not the rule, and our tolerance extends mainly to those who get fabulously wealthy or hold the promise of doing so. <br><br>Introversion&#x2014;along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness&#x2014;is now a second- class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man&#x2019;s world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we&#x2019;ve turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel we must conform. <br><br>The Extrovert Ideal has been documented in many studies, though this research has never been grouped under a single name. Talkative people, for example, are rated as smarter, better- looking, more interesting, and more desirable as friends. Velocity of speech counts as well as volume: we rank fast talkers as more competent and likable than slow ones. The same dynamics apply in groups, where research shows that the voluble are considered smarter than the reticent&#x2014;even though there&#x2019;s zero correlation between the gift of gab and good ideas. Even the word <i>introvert</i> is stigmatized&#x2014;one informal study, by psychologist Laurie Helgoe, found that introverts described their own physical appearance in vivid language ( &#x201c;green- blue eyes,&#x201d; &#x201c;exotic,&#x201d; &#x201c;high cheekbones&#x201d;), but when asked to describe generic introverts they drew a bland and distasteful picture (&#x201c;ungainly,&#x201d; &#x201c;neutral colors,&#x201d; &#x201c;skin problems&#x201d;).<br><br>But we make a grave mistake to embrace the Extrovert Ideal so unthinkingly. Some of our greatest ideas, art, and inventions&#x2014;from the theory of evolution to van Gogh&#x2019;s sunflowers to the personal computer&#x2014; came from quiet and cerebral people who knew how to tune in to their inner worlds and the treasures to be found there. <br><b><br>Copyright � 2012 by Susan Cain.

An intimate art form, drawing offers a direct connection to one&#x2019;s imagination; a means of exercising the eye, brain, and the hand; and a way to spark new ideas and resolve pictorial challenges. This volume features more than 100 exceptional drawings, pastels, watercolors, and collages from the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, which has been collecting drawings since the 1811 bequest of James Bowdoin III. The works exemplify what compels artists to draw and thus illustrate the ongoing relevance of drawing as the most foundational artistic practice. Gathered here for the first time in a book, the range, quality, and uniqueness of the drawings will captivate anyone interested in drawing as an art form. Reproduced in gorgeous color illustrations, works from Peter Paul Rubens to Mary Cassatt, Ed Ruscha, and Jim Dine are accompanied by brief commentary.

Where both mythology and heroic-adventure comics typically lean toward vast spectacle and archetypal characters, Shanower is uncompromising in his sharp, humanizing focus. Betrayal, Part 2, the second part of the third part of Shanower&#x2019;s projected seven-part series, begins with Achilles and his Myrmidons invading the beach of Troy and ends with Troilus&#x2019; breakdown during a bloody skirmish with a squad of Achaeans. The space between is filled with intrigue and conflict among a head-spinningly large cast, but in the midst of it all, he pays special attention to the heated romance of Troilus and Cressida. Shanower&#x2019;s keenly balanced approach to this colossal saga is apparent in the psychological insight he beautifully telegraphs in his characters&#x2019; words, actions, and finely lined faces; his encyclopedic knowledge of settings, clothing, weaponry, and ships, all accurately rendered to the finest archaeological detail; and his ability to make every panel, even those depicting battle, feel personal rather than merely epic.

Anna Kerrigan, nearly twelve years old, accompanies her father to the house of a man who, she gleans, is crucial to the survival of her father and her family. Anna observes the uniformed servants, the lavishing of toys on the children, and some secret pact between her father and Dexter Styles. Years later, her father has disappeared and the country is at war. Anna works at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where women are allowed to hold jobs that had always belonged to men. She becomes the first female diver, the most dangerous and exclusive of occupations, repairing the ships that will help America win the war. She is the sole provider for her mother, a farm girl who had a brief and glamorous career as a Ziegfield folly, and her lovely, severely disabled sister. At a night club, she chances to meet Styles, the man she visited with her father before he vanished, and she begins to understand the complexity of her father&#39;s life, the reasons he might have been murdered. Mesmerizing, hauntingly beautiful, with the pace and atmosphere of a noir thriller and a wealth of detail about organized crime, the merchant marine and the clash of classes in New York, Egan&#39;s first historical novel is a masterpiece, a deft, startling, intimate exploration of a transformative moment in the lives of women and men, America and the world.

Classic in the sense that it&#x2019;s virtually impossible to put down. Classic in its sepia toned portrait of New York: set on the Brooklyn docks during World War II, when mobsters ruled, the war loomed, and a young girl dove her way into becoming the first female diver on the squad. Classic in its quintessentially satisfying characters: crooked gangsters, disappearing fathers, gritty sailors and an intrepid young woman equally at home in a 200 pound diving suit and a green silk dress who unites them all. Classic in its revelation of the dangerous, altruistic and nefarious choices people make to support their family, their country and themselves. <em>Manhattan Beach</em> is classic in all of its American glory. <em>&#x2014;Al Woodworth</em>Jennifer Egan is the author of A Visit From The Goon Squad, The Keep, Look at Me, The Invisible Circus, and the story collection Emerald City.

When it comes to Falcon 4, the long-awaited and generally heralded F-16 jet combat simulation, Prima decided it was best to bring in some big guns. Peter Bonanni and James Reiner are both F-16 instructor pilots and graduates of the F-16 Fighter Weapons School. They also consulted on the development of the game, so it's safe to say that when these guys talk dogfighting tactics, they know what they're talking about. Still, this is the sort of book that is probably best suited for hardcore flight sim enthusiasts (which, come to think of it, is pretty much the demographic matching Falcon 4 players...). Beginning with some basics on the game and the various gameplay options, the book gives readers a quick and dirty guide to instant action missions, multiplayer dogfights, and full-fledged campaigns. After that, this guide is all business--I mean, any book that devotes separate chapters to laser-guided bombs and the AGM-65 Maverick missile is a hardcore title indeed. Studying the wealth of information in this guide, Falcon 4 pilots should be able to improve their skills in a hurry. In fact, after going through this manual a few times, you might just feel ready to take a real F-16 out for a spin...<p></p>The closest you&#39;ll get to F-16 combat!</p><h2>The Red Bandanna (Thorndike Press Large Print Popular and Narrative Nonfiction Series)</h2><p>The inspirational story of September 11 hero Welles Crowther traces his faith-based outlook on life, his position as a volunteer in his local fire department and desire to join the FDNY, and how he sacrificed his life to save people trapped in the South Tower.</p><p>Tom Rinaldi&nbsp;has been a national correspondent at ESPN since 2002.

On May 17<i>, </i>1977, in New York City,<i> </i>the first child of Alison and Jeff Crowther was born: Welles Remy Crowther.<br><br>The boy was named after a man his parents never met.<br><br>Henry Spalding Welles was Alison&#x2019;s great-uncle in several senses of the word, a figure shrouded in stories and tales, legends she&#x2019;d heard about since childhood. A favorite of Alison&#x2019;s father, Frank, Uncle Henry led an outsized life, certainly by the family&#x2019;s&nbsp;telling. Despite living in Manhattan, he was an accomplished professional sportsman, working as a hired shot and public marksman, for Remington, America&#x2019;s oldest gun maker. As legend had it, Uncle Henry once hit two hundred clays in succession in �competition, a display to prove the accuracy and effectiveness of �Remington&#x2019;s newest shotgun. He also worked for True Temper, a manufacturer of fishing rods and reels, and was accomplished as a fly fisherman. Uncle Henry invented and held a patent for a diving plug, a wooden lure carved and weighted to penetrate the surface&nbsp;of the water, to help catch fish in any type of water, any time of day.<br><br>For Alison, it wasn&#x2019;t so much the tales as the way they were told, the spark that came into her father&#x2019;s voice when he spoke about Henry Spalding Welles, the look that crossed his face.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought, what could be a better name?&#x201d; Alison recalled. &#x201c;There was just this magic about Uncle Henry.&#x201d; The stories about the man, the ones her family loved to tell with laughter and pride and wonder&#x2014;about beating Annie Oakley in a shooting competition, about sailing wooden boats across the ponds of Central Park, about President Eisenhower using his trout fishing flies&#x2014;all shared the theme of taking a bold and unpredicted line through life. It was a name they hoped their son would make his own.<br><br>Alison Remy&#x2019;s own line was a gentle loop, from the suburbs of Westchester to a campus in New England, then back south to Manhattan. She grew up in the house where her father did, the house her grandfather built on Shawnee Road in the wealthy village of&nbsp;Scarsdale, north of Manhattan. Her grandfather and father, Frank Remy Sr. and Frank Remy Jr., shared more than the family home; both were graduates of New York University, both were dentists, and both were athletes.<br><br>When Alison graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1966, she didn&#x2019;t follow the family path to NYU. Instead, she enrolled in Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. Founded as a female seminary in 1834, Wheaton was one of the oldest colleges for women in America. There were antiwar protests during her time there, but the small school was far from an epicenter of the countercultural unrest exploding across American campuses in the late 1960s, and the academic environment was serious and challenging. The student body, twelve hundred women by the time Alison graduated, was expected to be diligent, studious, and involved. That worked for Alison, who was a dedicated student with a passion for environmental studies. She headed the first Earth Day celebration on campus.<br><br>The summer before her junior year, she went on a blind date set up by another couple. Alison got the call only after the woman originally scheduled for the date had to cancel and the matchmakers didn&#x2019;t want to stand the suitor up or hurt his feelings. When Jeff Crowther walked into the room, Alison had a completely novel reaction:<br><br>&#x201c;It was love at first sight,&#x201d; she recalled. &#x201c;It really was.&#x201d;<br><br>For Jeff Crowther, the fact that his first date had canceled, upsetting the night&#x2019;s original plans, fit his own line well enough. If there was a prescribed path, odds were he wasn&#x2019;t following it.<br><br>Jeff had grown up in White Plains, a larger, more diverse city just north of Scarsdale. His family had its roots in Maryland, but his father&#x2019;s work brought them to New York. Bosley Crowther, a <i>New York Times</i> reporter, writer, and critic, spent forty years with the paper. As a student at Princeton, he entered a current events contest cosponsored by the <i>Times</i> and a new weekly magazine called <i>Time. </i>His essay, on why the Calvin Coolidge administration should withdraw its forces in Nicaragua, won first place. The prize? A five-hundred-dollar check and a job offer with the <i>New York Times.</i><br><br>Starting as a cub reporter in 1928, Crowther&nbsp;worked his way up&nbsp;to general reporter, rewrite man, feature writer, and then, in 1940, the paper&#x2019;s chief movie critic. He held the position for twenty-seven years, becoming an institution. Bosley&#x2019;s reviews held extraordinary weight, often setting up films for success or failure.<br><br>Though his father and grandfather had attended Princeton, Jeff went in a different direction. At his mother&#x2019;s suggestion, he headed to Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, a respected academic institution, though not overly challenging for him, at least not at first. He sailed through freshman year without developing any impulse to study, or even to attend classes regularly. By the end of his sophomore year, after spending his time betting on horses at a local track, playing pool in the basement of his dormitory, and impressing buddies as the social director for his fraternity, he was summoned by the dean and told he needed a break, to refocus. &#x201c;I got thrown out&#x201d; is how he characterized it.<br><br>Without telling his parents he had been suspended, Jeff took a step few saw coming: in the summer of 1965, he joined the navy, and was stationed in San Diego for his two years of service. By the time he returned east, he held a different, wiser view toward his college opportunity. He met Alison Remy just as he was getting ready to resume life as an undergrad, this time at NYU.<br><br>That first date was a smashing success. Alison returned home that night, found her father still up working in his office, and declared: &#x201c;Dad, I think I&#x2019;ve met the man I want to marry.&#x201d;<br><br>Her father was considerably less moved. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly&#x201d; was his reply.<br><br>A few miles north, Jeff told his mother the very same thing that night.<br><br>Alison had an intuition, a burgeoning feeling, about the night, about all connected to it&#x2014;the man she&#x2019;d met, the feelings he sparked, the summer fading and the autumn approaching. Even about the date itself.<br><br>&#x201c;I will never forget thinking,&#x201d; she recalled more than four decades later, &#x201c;this day, it&#x2019;s going to have a special meaning for us. I had a powerful sense about it, not only that we just met on this date, but there was something else that was going to make this an important day for our family&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice trailed off.<br><br>The year was 1968.<br><br>The date was September 11.<br><br>She graduated in 1970 with a degree in biology and landed a job in medical research at one of the most prestigious addresses for research in the country, Rockefeller University. Alison was going back to New York.<br><br>At Rockefeller, she was assigned to help with lab work on a project led by Dr. Vincent Dole and his wife, Dr. Marie Nyswander,&nbsp;who were pioneering the use of a new treatment for heroin addiction. The couple had developed a synthetic medication, �methadone, to reduce the intensely painful symptoms of withdrawal that so many addicts experienced in trying to get clean. At the time, addiction&nbsp;was widely seen as something other than a medical problem, viewed through a moral lens, as a defect of character. The doctors rejected&nbsp;that notion and pioneered the use of methadone to help �addicts wean&nbsp;themselves from heroin. For his work, Dole would receive the Lasker Award, one of the greatest prizes in American medicine.<br><br>Alison was working on lab experiments with mice and rats, injecting the rodents with radioactive methadone to track the effects over a span of months. She was also dating. And on a ferry ride to Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard in the fall of 1970, Jeff proposed. The wedding was the first day of May 1971.<br><br>They moved to an apartment in Hastings-on-Hudson, a quaint village in Westchester, and began a life together, Jeff as a banker and Alison continuing as a research assistant. They wanted to start a family, but it took awhile to happen. Alison stopped working at Rockefeller in 1976, to avoid any further exposure to the radioactivity in her lab. Later that year, she and Jeff told the family the news. Alison was expecting.<br><br><i>The slide show still plays in the father&#x2019;s head, a perpetual reel. No conscious decision clicks its carousel to life or chooses the sequence; there&#x2019;s no beam to ignite the dust floating between lens and screen. There is no screen at all, no place outside his head to play the slides. The pictures explode across the sides of his mind, sometimes with enough force to tighten his chest and steal his breath.</i><br><br><i>Every frame contains his son. A boy blossoming, awkward and �beautiful, unfolding into his own life. Rarely are the portraits from milestones, from the passages through the razor wire of adolescence, the first Communions and junior proms, the formal poses and family events, the birthday parties and holiday dinners. Those have moved to the background somehow.</i><br><br><i>The father can&#x2019;t stop the show, even if he wants to. He knows he won&#x2019;t ever keep them away. The visions come, uninvited and beyond any governing, a tax on his sorrow. The pictures thrill and sear him, comfort and afflict him.</i><br><br><i>The picture just now is the first frame in a short movie. The son is just a toddler, not even three years old. He is down on the floor in the living room, playing with the family dog. The two wrestle over a toy, which is the dog&#x2019;s property, the dog biting and the boy pulling, each holding on with all his might. The dog is bigger, stronger. From room to room, the father watches as the dog drags his son around, both wild with delight, neither willing to let go. They play until each is exhausted.</i><br><br><i>At times when the boy&#x2019;s grip weakens, his balance falters, and he slides into furniture and crashes into walls. But in the picture in the father&#x2019;s head, the boy won&#x2019;t stop, or cry, or look for help. In his tiny movie, flashing frame by frame, his son goes right back at the dog, until the dog is too tired to keep fighting. The game always ends the same way, with the toy in the boy&#x2019;s hands.</i><br><br>He knew what he wanted to do, and to be.<br><br>From the time Welles was in preschool, when he was asked about his future, he had an immediate and confident answer: he would be a fireman. Not like the ones in children&#x2019;s books, but like the people who shared his name and his house. From the time he was a tyke, both his grandfathers would take him to the firehouses in their respective cities&#x2014;Alison&#x2019;s father, Frank, to the red-tiled, brick-faced, double-doored Fire Station No. 2 in Hartsdale; Jeff&#x2019;s father, Bosley (whom the grandchildren called &#x201c;Geeps&#x201d;), to the firehouse in White Plains, just a few blocks from his&nbsp;house. They made the visits not because they were volunteers themselves; they saw the shine in their grandson&#x2019;s eyes, and fed his wonder.<br><br>Welles also liked to spend time with Geeps in his home office, &#x201c;playing business,&#x201d; as the boy called it, hiking himself up behind his grandfather&#x2019;s enormous desk in the sunroom, where Bosley would spend time writing. The interest in business would also last through most of his life. But it was an interest. Something to do. Not something to <i>be</i>. It wasn&#x2019;t firefighting.<br><br>The fireman&#x2019;s ideal was a magnet for Welles, as it is for so many boys of a certain age. The jubilant blast of the siren, the unpre�dictable call in the night, the monstrous gleam of the ladder truck, the fearsome power of the hose guns, the boots and turnouts and helmets, and the real and irresistible pull of fire&#x2014;its brilliance and drama and danger. A living thing, a real and attacking beast. The appeal lay in all of it, and something more, the chance to live out and execute an edict every child is taught but most forget fast: to help.<br><br>Christmas 1981, when Welles was four, his grandparents had a special gift for him, a blazing red ride-on fire truck. Upon first seeing it, Welles, who was formally dressed for the holiday in his little Eton suit, stood back for a few moments, as if uncertain how to proceed.<br><br>&#x201c;He was afraid to go near it,&#x201d; Alison said, picturing the scene. &#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t believe it was real. He was just so in awe of his fire&nbsp;truck. Maybe he was trying to figure out how they shrunk the truck down.&#x201d; So Welles simply stared at the small metal engine, with its black wheels and bright chrome and beckoning seat behind the steering wheel. How did Santa get it down the chimney? Eventually, he walked toward it, sat down in it, and attempted to maneuver it around the room.<br><br>&#x201c;He climbed in and tried to pedal it,&#x201d; Alison said. &#x201c;It was not easy to pedal.&#x201d;<br><br>The pedals were indeed difficult to crank, and soon the gleaming red sides wore a coat of dust. Even though Welles would ride it at times down the sloped driveway, screaming with joy, wild to the world, he outgrew its small frame soon enough, and the toy went downstairs in a corner of the house somewhere, ignored and unused.<br><br>But the memory of the day, of the gift beside the tree and Welles under its spell, remains.</p><h2>The Architectural Heritage of the Piscataqua: Houses and Gardens of The Portsmouth District in Maine</h2><p>The Architectural Heritage of the Piscataqua: Houses and Gardens of the Portsmouth District of Maine and New Hampshire by John Mead Howells is considered a classic book on the colonial architecture of the seacoast region of New Hampshire and southern Maine.

Among her many popular books for children are <em>Mangaboom</em>, illustrated by Anita Lobel; <em>Here Comes Henny </em>(based on the wordplay of James Joyce), illustrated by Nancy Winslow Parker; <em>Halfway to Your House</em>, illustrated by Gabrielle Vincent; <em>Flap Your Wings and Try</em> and <em>All Asleep</em>, illustrated by Nancy Tafuri; and <em>Posy</em>, illustrated by Catherine Stock (a Christopher Award book).</p>Pomerantz ( All Asleep ; Where's the Bear? ) charts the ordinary wishes and activities of preschoolers in low-key light verse, but the real voltage here is generated by Vincent's evocative art. Two friends agree to meet each other halfway between their houses, and will "decide about the other half / when we come to the halfway line." The narrator of a poem that begins "Peek-a-boo" complains that no one "can tell /who hides, /who seeks, / when everyone is / sneaking peeks." The 30 untitled verses sometimes disappoint with belabored attempts to imitate the voices of children: "I'd like to pat that cat, /that little kitty cat, /that itty bitty /soft and pretty / little kitty cat." Vincent's ( Ernest and Celestine ) engaging illustrations, originally published in France with a different text by Pili Mandelbaum, feature loosely wrought watercolor sketches with soft pencil outlines and pastel washes. Both cozy and animated, the pictures radiate a lively understanding of childhood.

Descended from a soldier of the Virginia Continental Line who fought in the American Revolution, Jakes is one of today&#x2019;s most distinguished authors of historical fiction.True love confronts Gilded Age class hierarchy in Jakes's latest engaging historical potboiler. Railroad tycoon Sam Driver sets out to conquer the summer resort of Newport, R.I., at the 1890s pinnacle of its glamour&#x2014;and snootiness&#x2014;in order to avenge its snubbing of his dead wife and find a prestigious match for his daughter, Jenny. It's a world ruled by New York socialites, where the slightest blemish of background or breach of protocol triggers ostracism. Sam struggles to conform while fending off the efforts of an old rival to exclude him, but Jenny throws a monkey wrench into things by falling in love with a handsome, lower-class Irishman. Jakes serves up a melodrama&#x2014;and satire&#x2014;of the tyranny of social convention with a girl-power ending. It doesn't always ring true, especially when Sam pressures Jenny to marry the obviously villainous Count Orlov, and action set pieces like a tennis match and a carriage race are less than gripping. But Jakes is a fluent storyteller, and his meticulous reconstruction of fin-de-si�cle excess will have fans savoring the lavish details of jewelry, fashion, food and follies. <i>(Nov. 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Berry also adds a deeply personal perspective to Hall's eloquent visual testimony. <br><br>With a farm of his own nearby, Berry was a longtime friend and neighbor of the families shown in Hall's pictures and took part in their work swapping. In addition to detailing the repetitive, strenuous labor involved in harvesting a tobacco crop, he relates memories of stories told, laughs shared, meals savored, and brief moments of rest and refreshment well earned. <br><br>Hall's striking photographs illuminate the characters and events that Berry describes. During the 1973 harvest, he photographed the rows stretching toward the horizon while laborers cut a tobacco crop, one plant at a time, until the last row was cut, hauled, and housed in the barn. These photographs powerfully convey the physical experiences of a Kentucky tobacco harvest: the heat of the sun, the dirt, and the people hard at work. <br><br><b>James Baker Hall</b>, former Kentucky Poet Laureate, is the author of many books, including <i>The Total Light Process</i> and <i>Yates Paul, His Grand Fights, His Tootings</i>. <br><br><b>Wendell Berry</b> is a poet, a novelist, a farmer, a conservationist, and a former professor of English.

How many days?" The journey ends on Sunday in Louisiana at the river's mouth, where a boy ponders: "Will I ever see where you start, big Mississippi?/Will I ever tell where you end/and the wide, wide sea begins?" The poetic text highlights a few important locations and historical events along the way. Lessac's primitive gouache illustrations brightly reflect each day's trip, showing children on the riverbanks engaging in interesting activities while barges, steamboats, and tugboats float by. The book opens with a map of the river's entire span, and every spread includes a smaller view of the day's featured area. Two pages of appended notes fill in some details about the places and events referred to in the narrative. Beautifully executed in text and illustrations, this title offers an enjoyable read as well as an educational one.

In this lively, irreverent memoir, Stubbs recounts the extraordinary, exasperating, and often hilarious adventures in his stellar career.<br><br>Illustrated with more than 150 color photographs of the spaces Stubbs has transformed, the book details the activities and thought processes that went into some of his most spectacular projects. These include the metamorphosis of an abandoned country dacha into a baronial mansion in the Ukraine, the renovation of a 100-year-old schoolhouse into stylish apartments for senior citizens in Newport, Rhode Island, and the project that inspired the book's title, a Houston penthouse designed around the color red, which caused his impulsive client to fire him over the phone. (Of course, when the client saw the finished apartment, he loved it-to the point that Stubbs had trouble convincing him to abandon the color in subsequent renovations.) This entertaining volume is a rarity, a design book that people will actually read. AUTHOR BIO: William W. Stubbs, founder and head of his own Houston-based firm, designs interior spaces, both commercial and residential, all over the world. He has been named to "The AD 100," <i>Architectural Digest's</i> list of the world's top designers and architects. He lives in Houston, Texas.</p><p>William W. Stubbs, founder and head of his own Houston-based firm, designs interior spaces, both commercial and residential, all over the world. He has been named to "The AD 100," <i>Architectural Digest's</i> list of the world's top designers and architects. He lives in Houston, Texas.Most decorating books give the impression that interior designers are refined, graceful individuals, the kind who sort through fabric and paint options while sipping a cup of afternoon tea. Stubbs, a high-end designer who has flown all over the world to renovate houses for the rich, appears to have no patience with such airy fantasies. In this photo-heavy memoir, he makes it clear that he has built his business on sweat and pragmatism as much as he has on taste. The secret to his success, he writes, has been the ability to say "Yes, I can do that" whenever he&#x2019;s confronted with a project&#x2014;no matter how impossible it seems. Stubbs begins his book by suggesting that decorating can be as exciting as joining the CIA; after reading his accounts of working in Kiev, Hawaii, Acapulco, Houston, Newport, London and the Ukraine, readers just might agree. His style is always sumptuous and ornate&#x2014;almost Trump-ish in its luxury&#x2014;but aside from the richness, he has no &#x2018;signature&#x2019; look. "My goal is always to have the client say, &#x2018;This is me!&#x2019;" he explains. So working with a couple of avid boaters, Stubbs trims the walls with woven grass paper and glowing yachtsman-style mahogany. And, working with an Eastern European oilman, he creates a palatial dacha filled with red drapes, gold trimmings and handcrafted white plaster. But what really holds the book together is Stubbs down-home humor. He freely admits that his guidance counselor once told him, "Bill, with your grades, you should consider going into air-conditioning repair." This book is an amusing account of what he did instead.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, drawing on thousands of documents from the CIA, the National Security Council, the Pentagon, and development agencies, James Peck shows in blunt detail how Washington has shaped human rights into a potent ideological weapon for purposes having little to do with rights&#x2014;and everything to do with furthering America's global reach.</p><p>Using the words of Washington's leaders when they are speaking among themselves, Peck tracks the rise of human rights from its dismissal in the cold war years as "fuzzy minded" to its calculated adoption, after the Vietnam War, as a rationale for American foreign engagement. He considers such milestones as the fight for Soviet dissidents, Tiananmen Square, and today's war on terror, exposing in the process how the human rights movement has too often failed to challenge Washington's strategies. </p><p>A gripping and elegant work of analysis, Ideal Illusions argues that the movement must break free from Washington if it is to develop a truly uncompromising critique of power in all its forms. </p></p><p><p>James Peck is the author of <i>Washington's China</i>. Founder of the Culture and Civilization of China project at Yale University Press and the China International Publishing Group in Beijing, he has written for <i>The New York Times</i> and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, among other publications. He lives in New York City.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>"Follow an idea through from its birth to its triumph," Bertrand de Jouvenel observed in his 1948 volume <i>On Power</i>, "and it becomes clear that it came to power only at the price of an astounding degradation of itself. The result is not reason which has found a guide but passion which has found a flag."1 The widely heralded rise of human rights is not free of such complications. For the history of human rights in the United States&#x2014;as a movement, as an impassioned language of good intentions, and as an invocation of American idealism&#x2014;owes far more to the inner ideological needs of Washington's national security establishment than to any deepening of conscience effected by the human rights movement. Thousands of national security documents (from the CIA, the National Security Council, the Pentagon, think tanks, and U.S. government development agencies) reveal how Washington set out after the Vietnam War to craft human rights into a new language of power designed to promote American foreign policy. They shed light on the way Washington has shaped this soaring idealism into a potent ideological weapon for ends having little to do with human rights&#x2014;and everything to do with extending America's global reach.</p><p>This obviously isn't the way human rights leaders have understood the movement's history. For years they extolled its rise as the triumph of a compelling new moral vision that began with the United Nations' Universal Declaration on Human Rights in 1948. Out of the reaction to Nazi atrocities, goes the popular narrative, came human rights. Never again would the world stand by in the face of wholesale torture and murder. As human rights became the vocabulary of a vibrant new conception of public good, it promised a sense of solidarity beyond borders, a voice raised on behalf of victims everywhere. By the late 1970s, these early hopes and aspirations had come to flourish in a vigorous movement developing in think tanks, foundations, law schools, UN forums, congressional committees, professional associations, and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).</p><p>The United States, with its longstanding ideals and its traditional respect for civil liberties, was a natural ally, a powerful force for global human rights, according to Amnesty International USA.2 The greatest advantage of Human Rights Watch, wrote its longtime director, Aryeh Neier, was its "identification with a country with a reputation for respecting rights."3 Of course, the movement's leaders note, Washington itself has committed some terrible human rights violations&#x2014;CIA-fomented coups, renditions, Guantv�namo. But these and similar "mistakes" or "shortsighted strategic calculations" could not permanently tarnish Washington's moral authority. When mistakes or crimes occurred, those committed to opposing such egregious acts saw their task as shaming Washington into changing its ways.</p><p>At the same time, the willingness of American citizens to expose their own government's brutalities offered further evidence of freedom at work. For the movement's leaders and for many ordinary citizens, the ability to criticize was inextricably paired with the nation's deeper virtue. No other country enjoyed such immunity. Indeed, where the countless human rights abuses committed by the Soviet Union, China, and other nations exposed who they really were, our own were aberrant&#x2014;a reflection of who we really weren't. Whatever moral equivalence there was among atrocities did not extend to the parties committing them. American policies were fundamentally progressive. With all these views Washington's foreign policy leaders heartily concurred.</p><p>Of course, when a government and its critics share the same language, they are not necessarily saying the same thing. But adept leaders, as Harold Lasswell noted in his classic 1927 study <i>Propaganda Technique in the World War</i>, know that "more can be won by illusion than coercion."4 And no ideological formulation has been more astutely propagated by Washington for the past four decades than the notion that a "rights-based" United States is the natural proponent of human rights throughout the world. In part, the rise of human rights recapitulates the old tale of popular idealism seeking to affect power, and power, in turn, shrewdly subverting that idealism to its own ends. Even as the human rights community has methodically focused on Washington's&#x2014;and others'&#x2014;many violations, it has largely recoiled from analyzing the fundamental structures of American power. As a result, it has unwittingly served some of Washington's deepest ideological needs.</p><p>Not enough attention has been paid to the interweaving of idealism and national security concerns, yet it is here that the real history of human rights can be found. Human rights erupted into the mainstream of public debate only because two quite distinct needs came together. On one side, a profound revulsion over the Vietnam War led to the weakening of the anticommunist consensus. Appalled by Cold War rationales and tactics (overthrowing regimes, assassinating leaders, training torturers, supporting dictatorships), human rights advocates mobilized against both American "excesses" and Soviet "crimes," documenting in particular the atrocities of American-backed military regimes throughout Latin America, from Guatemala to Chile. On the other side, Washington was desperate for new ideological weapons to justify&#x2014;both at home and abroad&#x2014;its global strategies. Human rights advocates sought to infuse Washington's policies with their high-minded ethos just as Washington was fashioning a rights-based vision of America to support its resurgent global aims.</p><p>A central question is: who influenced whom? Human rights leaders are convinced they pressured Washington into taking up their cause. Yet in truth their movement gained much of its momentum from Washington's subtle promotion of what they think of as their own agenda. Before the major American rights groups were created, Washington's national security managers had been discussing the desirability of a national organization to offset the "foreign" influence of the London-based Amnesty International. Before human rights leaders began advocating for extending the laws of war to outlaw abuses by antigovernment guerrilla forces, Washington pursued the same goal as&nbsp;a way of discrediting almost all insurgency movements. And a new humanitarian ethos legitimizing massive interventions&#x2014;including war&#x2014;emerged in the 1990s only after Washington had been pushing such an approach for some time. In short, the vocabulary and the arguments of the human rights movement almost all have significant precursors in Washington's national security concerns.</p><p>From Washington's perspective, the fierce Cold War ideological battles between the "Free World" and its adversaries necessitated lumping together a wide array of radical movements, dissident ideas, and nationalist struggles&#x2014;all perceived to be inimical to the demands of an America-centered world&#x2014;in order to dismiss them. But Washington knew all too well that the Free World could hardly restrict its constituents to free countries; it had to align itself with various dictators and brutally repressive regimes. Still, the great "war of ideas" demanded a line be drawn between democratic societies&#x2014;with free institutions, representative government, and free elections&#x2014;and those that denied freedom and individual rights.</p><p>From the earliest years of the Cold War, Washington predicated its war of ideas on a set of deep divisions: between freedom and equality, reform and revolution, self-interest and collective interests, the free market and state planning, and pluralistic democracy and mass mobilization. American human rights leaders largely, if unknowingly, built on this divide. They usually felt more at ease associating human rights with civil rights and political freedoms, the individual, the market, and pluralistic openness, while seeing the perils in revolution and concentrations of state power. They preferred not to dwell on what might compel populations, as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights warned, "to rebellion against tyranny and oppression"; nor did they acknowledge that it often takes militant mass movements, both violent and nonviolent, to pressure states and powerful interests into acquiescing to programs promoting greater social justice. They considered the struggle for human rights largely apart from peace movements and efforts toward disarmament and the banning of nuclear weaponry, and they took no stand on issues of war and aggression. They mostly viewed resistance movements through the prism of individual rights rather than considering the role of resistance and mass mobilizations in the creation and nourishment of rights.</p><p>That Washington has sought to fashion both the conceptual basis and the direction of the human rights movement is hardly surprising&#x2014;which is not to say that Washington controls the agenda, or that the national security establishment is not constantly competing with Congress, the media, and highly contentious interests abroad. Washington continually has to scramble, searching for ways to refine its strategies and bend ways of thinking to its own ideological ends. Still, it has remained as adept as it was during the Cold War at molding concepts, ideas, and code words. Understanding this process is key to understanding why the human rights movement has developed as it has.</p><p>The popular view of a rights-based, democratic American power not only obfuscates the way Washington operates but also advances a rather one-dimensional and parochial vision of human rights. We might more usefully look at human rights as two currents&#x2014;sometimes contending, sometimes complementary. The first current largely embodies the popular American view, which emphasizes civil and political rights and embraces a moderate, democratic, step-by-step incorporation of human needs into a kind of rights-based legalism. Perhaps such rights are easier to understand in terms of individual freedom: they do more to liberate individuals from the deprivations of caste than of class, freeing them from archaic restraints and traditions but not from economic subjugation. And the outcome is paradoxical. Violations of women's rights, gay rights, and civil rights of all kinds are increasingly attacked while inequality grows. Diversity and multiculturalism are lauded even as the concentration of wealth and power reaches historic levels. The "laws of war" are applauded and efforts to protect the rights of noncombatants flourish even as wars rage and the larger issues of aggression and occupation are ignored.</p><p>The second current has less to do with individual freedom and more to do with basic needs. It is associated with popular mass movements, revolution by populations in desperate straits, and resistance. From this perspective, the human rights movement emerged not only as a response to the savagery of World War II and the Holocaust but, more significantly, out of the movements for independence that broke the grip of European colonialism. Central to the second current are challenges to corporate power, state repression, foreign occupation, and global economic inequality, as well as the protection of collective means of struggle, from labor unions to revolution. Historically, this current affirms the mass-based challenges that allowed human rights to emerge in the first place. It is the drive for both freedom <i>and</i> equality, so deeply embedded in diverse revolutionary traditions and popular struggles for emancipation and justice, that galvanizes this vision of human rights. Today, this current is far more prevalent outside the dominant Western spheres of power.</p><p>The first current tends to speak in terms of victims and perpetrators. The second judges a society by how well it treats the poor and the weak. It challenges power by asking why, in large areas of the world where civil liberties and the "rule of law" do hold sway, so little is done to meet the most basic economic, medical, and educational needs of the populace. The second current, then, is less about infusing rights into preexisting structures of power than about fundamentally altering how power works; it is more about transforming the institutional apparatus and the military basis of political power than about invoking rights to control it.</p><p>There have been laudable, if infrequent, efforts to honor both currents together. Martin Luther King Jr., for example, fiercely opposed the Vietnam War, insisting that the civil rights and peace movements needed each other to bring about a better world. But there has been little subsequent support for such a merger either in Washington or in the human rights movement. Instead, the prevailing individual-freedom view of human rights has repeatedly been invoked to condemn the "dark underside" of revolution, the corruptions of unchecked state power, the lip service to equality paid by hypocritical leaders busily suppressing freedom&#x2014;but not to condemn aggression or crimes against peace.</p><p>For most human rights leaders today, the long travails of decolonialization and revolution and the search for alternatives to market-driven economic development represent little more than the backwaters of old Cold War battles that were hardly about rights at all. One looks almost in vain for accounts that show how Western power long subordinated the development of the Southern Hemisphere to its own needs and desires, how challenges in the non-Western world propelled the development of human rights laws and ideas, and how mass mobilizations broke the Gordian knot of colonialism and liberalism. Nor do human rights textbooks devote many pages to the great mass movements&#x2014;not even the civil rights movement in the United States or the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa.5 The major studies of human rights law spend their time instead debating how to enforce UN pronouncements and covenants. The language of law dominates the discussion. But law is the language of institutions, courts, and politicians. The teachings of Mohandas Gandhi and King and the language of impassioned justice are notably absent.</p><p>The movement's deep uneasiness with all forms of radical and revolutionary social change was already evident in 1961, when the newly founded Amnesty International pronounced that no prisoners who advocated violence could be considered prisoners of conscience: thus no revolutionaries&#x2014;not Nelson Mandela in South Africa, nor even the Berrigan brothers (who had destroyed draft-board records) in the United States. The movement has generally criticized revolutions and decolonializing rebellions as human rights travesties. No insurgency, including those in Vietnam and El Salvador, has escaped its censure for the killing of innocent civilians and the use of terror. No state redistributions of wealth and power have failed to rack up human rights violations; the Chinese Revolution is regarded as one huge atrocity. The Iranian Revolution is attacked as little more than a precursor to further repression. The upheavals of decolonialization are blamed for having opened the way to repressive authoritarian states.</p><p>Meanwhile, the virulent hostility of the United States in all these situations is either ignored in human rights reports or else dismissed as irrelevant to judg...</p></p><h2>I Swear I Was There: Sex Pistols, Manchester and the Gig that Changed the World</h2><p>When the Sex Pistols played Manchester in 1976&#x2014;what the <i>NME</i> named the most important gig of all time&#x2014;they set off a series of musical detonations that are still being felt today.

With an eloquence that resonates more than a century after its original publication in 1850, the narrative bears witness to Sojourner Truth's thirty years of bondage in upstate New York and to the mystical revelations that turned her into a passionate and indefatigable abolitionist. <br>In this new edition, which has been edited and extensively annotated by the distinguished scholar and biographer of Sojourner Truth, Margaret Washington, Truth's testimony takes on added dimensions: as a lens into the little-known world of northern slavery; as a chronicle of spiritual conversion; and as an inspiring account of a black woman striving for personal and political empowerment.</p><h2>The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660-1783</h2><p><p>Noted nineteenth-century U.S. naval officer and historian Alfred Thayer Mahan argues that, despite great changes and scientific advances in naval weaponry, certain principles of naval strategy remain constant.</p></p><p>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) was an American naval officer and lecturer. This highly influential volume, first published in 1890, contains Mahan&#39;s analysis and discussions of the factors leading to Britain&#39;s naval domination in the eighteenth century, with strategic and tactical recommendations based on these factors.<p>"Captain Mahan has written distinctively the best and most important, and also by far the most interesting, book on naval history which has been produced on either side of the water for many a long year." <br>--Atlantic Monthly <br>October 1890</p><p>First published over a century ago, this classic text on the history and tactics of naval warfare had a profound effect on the training of officers and the deployment of naval resources around the globe. Many of the world's great military strategists since 1890 have avidly read this book, including both Franklin Delano and Theodore Roosevelt, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and a host of admirals, chancellors, prime ministers, kings, and other presidents. It continues to be a primary reference for naval students and historians.</p><p>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783 presents the argument that, despite great changes and scientific advances in naval weaponry, certain principles of naval strategy remain constant. Beginning in the time of Alexander the Great, those nations with strong commercial and military command of the seas were the nations of greatest strength, wealth, and power. Though the determinants of military supremacy and the global balance of power have changed due to tremendous advances in technology, the principles and strategies discussed in the book remain creditable. The extensive presentation of the history of high-seas navigation alone makes this book an invaluable resource, as it has been credited with stimulating the growth of modern navies in leading countries of the world.</p><p>Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) served in the Civil War and twice served as the president of the United States Naval War College, beginning shortly after the college was founded. Mahan became known as one of the leading spokesmen for the age of American imperialism. In addition to his books on the history of naval warfare, he wrote biographies of David Farragut and Horatio Nelson.</p></p><h2>Living history of Israel;: A paraphrase of Joshua, Judges, I and II Samuel, I and II Kings, I and II Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah</h2><p>Living history of Israel;: A paraphrase of Joshua, Judges, I and II Samuel, I and II Kings, I and II Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah [Jan 01, 1970] Taylor, Kenneth Nathaniel</p><p></p><h2>Glastonbury Tor: A Guide to the History and Legends</h2><p>GLASTONBURY TOR: A GUIDE TO THE HISTORY AND LEGENDS - unknown - TRISKELE PUBLICATIONS</p><p></p><h2>The Invasion of 1910: Illustrated</h2><p>The Invasion of 1910 is a 1906 novel written mainly by William Le Queux. It is one of the more famous examples of Invasion literature. It is viewed by some as an example of pre-World War I Germanophobia. It can also be viewed as prescient, as it preached the need to prepare for war with Germany. The novel was originally commissioned by Alfred Harmsworth as a serial which appeared in the Daily Mail from 19 March 1906. The story rewritten to feature towns and villages with high Daily Mail readership, greatly increased the newspaper&#39;s circulation and made a small fortune for Le Queux; it was translated into twenty-seven languages, and over one million copies of the book edition were sold. The idea for the novel is alleged to have originated from Field Marshal Earl Roberts, who regularly lectured English schoolboys on the need to prepare for war.

Duddy -- the third generation of a Jewish immigrant family in Montreal -- is combative, amoral, scheming, a liar, and totally hilarious. From his street days tormenting teachers at the Jewish academy to his time hustling four jobs at once in a grand plan to &#34;be somebody,&#34; Duddy learns about living -- and the lesson is an outrageous roller-coaster ride through the human comedy. As Richler turns his blistering commentary on love, money, and politics, The Apprenticeship Of Duddy Kravitz becomes a lesson for us all...in laughter and in life.</p><p><i>The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz</i> is the novel that established Mordecai Richler as one of the world?s best comic writers. Growing up in the heart of Montreal?s Jewish ghetto, Duddy Kravitz is obsessed with his grandfather?s saying, ?A man without land is nothing.? In his relentless pursuit of property and his drive to become a somebody, he will wheel and deal, he will swindle and forge, he will even try making movies. And in spite of the setbacks he suffers, the sacrifices he must make along the way, Duddy never loses faith that his dream is worth the price he must pay. This blistering satire traces the eventful coming-of-age of a cynical dreamer. Amoral, inventive, ruthless, and scheming, Duddy Kravitz is one of the most magnetic anti-heroes in literature, a man who learns the hard way that dreams are never exactly what they seem, even when they do come true.Mordecai Richler (1931-2001) was a Canadian author, scriptwriter, and essayist. Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, in his early years he lived and wrote in England but returned to Canada in 1972. He was the author of ten novels, including Barney&#39;s Version (1997), Solomon Gursky Was Here (1989), Cocksure (1968), and The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1959), as well as numerous screenplays, essays, children&#39;s books, and several works of non-fiction.

Photographed at the Florida Museum of Natural History, which houses one of the world's largest butterfly collections, this book features superb full-color portraits of these "jewels of creation." <p>In addition to descriptions of each species, the author also discusses the current recognition of butterflies as the mark of a healthy environment and indicates which species are protected by various conservation authorities.</p> <p>Among the many subjects covered are such topics as: <br>-- Taxonomy and structure<br>-- Lifestyle and migration<br>-- Tips on butterfly watching and where to find them</p> <p>Including an index to both common and scientific names of species, ths is the ultimate reference for butterflies, an ideal guide and source book, providing everything one needs to identify all varieties of butterflies.</p>The success or failure of butterfly populations is now recognized as an indicator of an ecosystem's health. In this beautiful book, Feltwell devotes a chapter to the state of butterfly populations and the pressures on their habitats. The destruction of habitats is not the only threat; prize butterfly specimens command $1,000 or more.<p>This survey presentation for the amateur or professional lepidopterist can be used with pleasure by the general reader. A brief chapter includes an explanation of how to interpret the symbols used in the capsule descriptions of the more than 1,000 butterflies. Sidebars scattered throughout the introductory text provide quick looks at aspects of the butterfly world.</p><p>The chapter "Superlatives" is full of butterfly trivia. For example, Queen Alexandra's Birdwing (<i>Ornithoptera alexandrae</i>) is so big (over 11 inches) that the first specimen collected in New Guinea was shot out of a tree. "Butterfly Families" describes the four main families briefly. "Morphology" provides a detailed diagram of a generic butterfly and a separate drawing of the wing mechanism. "Butterfly Life Cycles" and "Migration" provide surveys of those topics, and "Butterfly Watching" gives advice on how to start looking at butterflies.</p><p>The next four chapters contain photographs of the four families grouped by genus. Each genus has a short description and a color photograph of a representative specimen. For each butterfly, there is a descriptive paragraph and a key noting family, geographic zone, size, and an icon indicating threatened/nonthreatened status. If specimens are female, the appropriate gender symbol is given. A symbol notes those species that are more colorful ventrally than dorsally.</p><p>The photographs, made from specimens at the Allyn Museum of Entomology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, are stunning. The color reproduction is clear and accurate. The "candid" photographs in the introductory chapters are also impressive. An index includes both scientific and common names. Tucked away at the end of the book are a brief bibliography and addresses of some entomological and butterfly societies.</p><p>While it is too large for a field guide and lacks the scholarly apparatus of an academic work, this book merits consideration by both academic and public libraries for the photographs alone, although the text is useful for someone who knows little about butterflies. The price brings it within the range of all but the most limited book budgets. <i></i></p></p><h2>Spytime: The Undoing of James Jesus Angleton</h2><p>James Jesus Angleton was an enigma, a secretive man whose power was at its peak during the height of the Cold War. Founder of U.S. counter-intelligence, hunter of moles and foes of America, his name has become synonymous with skulduggery and subterfuge. Angleton pursued his enemies, real and imagined, with a cool, calculating intelligence. Eventually convinced that there was a turncoat within the highest reaches of the U.S. government, Angleton turned all of his considerable skills to finding and exposing him. The result was a near-victory for U.S. Intelligence-and total defeat for himself. A brilliant re-creation of a world that included Soviet defectors, the infamous traitors Burgess, MacLean, and Philby, and American presidents from Truman to Carter, <i>Spytime</i> traces the making-and unmaking-of a man without a peer and, at the end, a man without a country to serve. <br></p><p>This fictional account of the life of James Jesus Angleton, founder of the American counterintelligence establishment, will make readers wish for the humor and high jinks of Blackie Oakes, William F. Buckley Jr.'s much more engaging fictional spy. As the novel opens, Angleton is being summarily locked out of the halls of power and plotting his final act: the unmasking of the famed Fifth Man involved in the scandals that rocked England when Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, and Anthony Blount were unmasked as traitors. But before he lets the reader in on the identity of the Fifth Man, Buckley traces Angleton's career through his involvement in a number of espionage cases, all rooted in the cold war and apparently chosen to illustrate Buckley's ongoing (and already decided) battle with his favorite nemesis, Soviet communism.<p> Angleton's lifelong obsession with Philby is the engine that drives <i>Spytime</i>, but there are too many miles on it to make what passes for a plot hold the reader's interest. On the brighter side, Buckley's erudition puts a fine polish on the chassis. <i>Cold Warrior</i>, Tom Mangold's fine biography of Angleton, is a more evenhanded treatment of the life of this complicated man, but Buckley's is more fun to take to the beach. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>William F. Buckley Jr. is the founder of the <i>National Review</i> and was the host of what was television's longest-running program, <i>Firing Line</i>.

In August 1485, after long years of precarious exile, Henry landed in South Wales to challenge the throne with a motley army of French and Scottish troops and English fugitives. Presenting himself as the unifier of the warring Houses of York and Lancaster, and as heir to both dynasties, he promised to free an oppressed people from Richard Plantagenet, `homicide and unnatural tyrant'. At Bosworth Field in Leicestershire Richard charged into the midst of the usurper's army and, abandoned by his supposed allies and by the God of battles, was cut down. He lost his kingdom and his life and left Henry Tudor, for the while, without a rival. The Tudor adventurer found himself king by right of conquest, by inheritance and by acclamation, of a country he neither knew nor understood.</p><p>&nbsp;Henry Tudor was born in Pembroke in 1457, and had fled there once before, for shelter, in 1470-71. It was to Pembroke and to Wales that he returned in 1485, hoping for popular support and promising to restore lost freedoms. As he marched through the coastal lowlands and northwards he saw at first a landscape of mixed farming, where the furrows of ploughland traced agricultural progress. Making his way through the centre of the principality, he entered a bleaker territory of mountain and moorland, of rocky, barren heath where sheep and cattle grazed, but where otherwise signs of cultivation were few, for the people accepted the constraints of nature. Perhaps 200,000 people lived in Wales then, bound by a strong sense of national identity, made clear in their use of the name <i>Cymry</i>, 'people of one region'. Most of these people lived in the lowlands, in villages, while in the pastoral uplands there were single farmsteads in lonely valleys. Henry Tudor's forced march into England led across the mountains of mid Wales to the lordships of the Welsh Marches, to Welshpool and the Shropshire plain beyond. He marched over Long Mountain down the Roman road to Shrewsbury, into the English Midlands, and to victorious battle with Richard III on 22 August.</p><p>Henry's passage from Wales to Bosworth Field in the heart of England showed him the diversity of the dominions he now claimed. Nature had defined the patterns of terrain and soil, of lowland and hills, of the prevailing wind and rainfall, which human labour could exploit but never change. The landscape determined the patterns not only of cultivation, but also of inheritance and social relations; as the landscape changed, even within counties, so did the character of settlement. The fenlands and marshlands and wild upland dales each created their own distinct agricultural and social worlds, and with transport slow and laborious, every region was highly localized and fragmented. In Leicestershire, where he took his crown, Henry was in the heart of open-field countryside &#x2014; ploughland, where land was intensively cultivated according to communal rules. Here he could survey a patchwork of green and gold, furlongs of corn and crops in hedgeless fields. There was forest there also, Charnwood Forest, and tilled fields might always revert to forest. The people of England had waged war upon nature &#x2014; clearing, felling, ploughing, draining &#x2014; but with more energy at some times and in some places. The retreat of the population after the devastating plagues of the mid fourteenth century, and the continuing epidemic illnesses and stagnation of the population through the next century, had brought a retreat in cultivation. As Henry entered this kingdom he claimed, there were perhaps two and a half or three million people in England and Wales. Within a generation the population began to rise dramatically, and with that rise came great alterations to the seemingly immemorial, changeless character of rural society.</p><p>Describing the landscape, contemporaries distinguished not between highland and lowland, but between champion (open) ground and woodland, between a pattern of arable farming and a pastoral landscape with isolated farmsteads set amidst their closes of pasture. In fielden country there were numerous villages and towns, surrounded by their common fields, with houses and hovels clustered around parish church and manor house. In woodland areas towns were few and far between, settlement dispersed. The distinction between arable and pastoral was moral as well as topographical: where the land was uncultivated so the people were believed to be also. Forest and pastoralism were associated with a more primitive, barbaric state.</p><p>As Henry surveyed his realm, he saw more sheep than people; those sheep which More would characterize as 'devourers of men'. Vast areas of open-field arable land were being converted to sheep and cattle pasture in the later fifteenth century, and where before a hundred arable labourers had tilled and harrowed, now a few shepherds watched. In most of England &#x2014; the south-east, south-west and north &#x2014; the countryside had been fenced and enclosed before, often long before, and these anciently enclosed lands had their own character. Nearly a century later, in 1572, the Duke of Norfolk defended himself against the charge of planning an invasion through Harwich by asking rhetorically who would choose to lead an army through an area so wholly enclosed by hedges and encumbered by narrow paths. In the Midlands conversion from tillage to pasture was taking place as Henry Tudor came to the throne, as lords of the manor and great freeholders took commercial decisions with devastating consequences for communities, evicting tenants who were powerless to oppose when lands and lives were determined at the lord's will. Enclosure was caused by decay and depopulation, as well as causing them, for population decline had led to labour shortage. But now the population began to rise, and with that rise came a drive to cultivate in order to feed.</p><p>The new king could see the patterns of landscape and cultivation as he passed. He knew that all lordship, influence and status rested upon land, and understood the sanctity of landed property, which no king must violate. His seizure of the crown had made him the greatest landowner in England, and he would become greater still. Yet what neither he, nor anyone else, could tell just by looking was how the land was held; who held freehold as free tenants, and who held land at the lord's will as customary tenants and copyholders, owing him fees and fines and duties. The nature of ownership dictated where power lay and determined or disturbed the peace of the countryside. Some land was left 'waste', in its natural state, for the common grazing which was vital for the whole economy, and especially for the landless poor. This common land was about to become overstocked and under threat. If the King had cared to observe them, the social inequalities, and the poverty, were manifest, even in the fertile landscape of the east Midlands. Here about one third of the male population were cottagers and labourers, with little hope of acquiring their own farms, and facing a hard struggle even to defend their common grazing. A quarter of the personal wealth of Leicestershire villagers in the early sixteenth century was held by 4 per cent of the people. Such inequalities were taken as part of the divine and natural order, which no one should question. As the first Tudor king passed by, the common people looked on, their lives affected more by the fecundity of the harvest, which happened to be good in 1485, than by any change of dynasty.</p><p>Henry had been crowned on the battlefield with the crown of the fallen King, and acclaimed by his troops. Taking oaths of allegiance from the towns on his way, he marched on slowly towards London, the capital and centre of trade, and nearby Westminster, the heart of government. London was England's largest city, but its population was only about 50,000. The population of Paris was three or four times as large. The citizens of London boasted of their worldwide trade, but they lived in a city of one square mile, bound still within its ancient and defensible walls. London was a great franchise, proud of its freedoms and wealth, arrogant in its claims. The City's loyalty must be won and its conformity assured, but it had in its long history often shown sympathies quite different from those the Crown required. London was small enough for news to travel fast, and for causes to be swiftly followed; it was large enough for a formidable volume of support or resentment to grow and for fearsome numbers to gather. Its citizens had acquiesced sullenly at Richard III's usurpation, and regretted it; they welcomed Henry Tudor at his accession, and came to regret it.</p><p>The towers and steeples of London's hundred parish churches and its many religious houses dominated the skyline, for none of the laity aspired to build to rival the Church, and only the Guildhall, the seat of the City's governors, and the daunting Tower could compare in grandeur. To the north door of St Paul's Cathedral the new king came to offer his battle standards in thanks to the giver of victory. One bore the red dragon of Cadwaladr, symbolizing Tudor descent from the ancient British kings who had defeated the Saxon invaders. Another banner carried the symbol of St George of England; another the Lancastrian and Beaufort emblems. On 30 October Henry VII was crowned, swearing the oath sworn by kings long before him to keep the peace to clergy and people, to do justice in mercy and in truth, and to maintain the laws: an oath which few had been able to keep. His marriage in January 1486 to Elizabeth of York, Edward IV's daughter, sealed his pact with the Yorkists, merged the Yorkist claim with the Tudors, and promised an end to the civil wars between Lancaster and York. A prince was born within the year. They called him Arthur, with evident promise, recalling the Arthurian past and ancient British blood of the Tudors, and looking to the future of the dynasty.</p><p>'Britain' was an ancient land of myth, not a political reality. When Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey wrote in his last poem of the blood which he had shed 'for Britannes sake', he used a term of art, for the lands of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland were very far from being united as 'Britain'. Henry was acclaimed 'by the grace of God, King of England and of France, Prince of Wales and Lord of Ireland'. Until only a generation earlier the English monarchy had also ruled Gascony and Normandy. Now only Calais was still in English possession, a military outpost, but the claim to the throne of France and the Angevin empire lived on. It was France and French ways of governing which Henry knew best, after long exile in France and ducal Brittany: it was England which this inexperienced, stranger king must now rule. England was an ancient, unified and intensively governed realm. Compared with the other kingdoms of late medieval Europe, it had remarkable governmental coherence and lack of provincial autonomy and custom. There was a common law, a common language (save in distant, Celtic Cornwall) and a common coinage. A sophisticated and intrusive bureaucracy, centred at Westminster, through proper forms and channels sent tens of thousands of parchment directives every year into the shires. This was an administration which meant to keep the peace even down to village level, and to protect the property of the king's free subjects. In war, it could marshal and provision forces. Taxation was freely granted in Parliament and duly collected. And yet this <i>public</i> authority, its administration of justice, its maintenance of peace and order, was upheld &#x2014; and could be subverted &#x2014; by the <i>private</i> power and personal lordship of the king's leading landed subjects: upon their consent and cooperation the whole system of governance depended. The king, as the greatest of lords and of landholders, had his <i>private</i> following (or affinity), but in his <i>public</i> role as king he had hardly any paid officials and no standing military force. He must rely upon the private forces of his magnates for the maintenance of order during peace time and for troops to wage war.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magnates, the great nobility &#x2014; the tiny group of peers who alone had titles of nobility and who were the king's natural counsellors &#x2014; ruled in their 'countries', as they called them, as the king did in the realm. Through their personal lordship they maintained the peace and protected the interests of their dependent gentry and peasant tenants. The nobility had great power and wealth, and might have paramount influence in their 'countries', but no lord could exercise a local tyranny. After the demise of Richard III no noble held the awesome regional hegemony that he had done in his great northern territory. In a firmly hierarchical society the knights, esquires and gentlemen looked to nobles for patronage and protection, and expected them to maintain and restore social peace by arbitration and reconciliation. Yet the gentry were also increasingly independent, self-regarding, and capable of managing both their own affairs and those of their county commonwealths, in which their collective wealth and land gave them so large a stake. The nobility, in their turn, looked to them for local support and the Crown looked to them to run the shires. The county gentry were entrusted with great and wide-ranging authority: as Justices of the Peace, assessors of taxes, arrayers of troops, commissioners of many kinds, and as county representatives in the House of Commons. Lesser gentry served as coroners and tax collectors, and beneath them, in manors and villages, husbandmen (poorer farmers) too sought a share in the activity of governing, acting as constables and jurymen. Despite intense competitiveness and frequent feuding, local society had a will to peace and stability. A wise king understood that, lacking the power to compel and enforce, he must inspire and lead; he must command the loyalty of a political nation deeply versed in government and anxious to participate.</p><p>As in all personal lordships, the character and ability of the king was vital. The realm was not only his kingdom and personal estate, but a commonwealth, a polity, and he must rule in his subjects' interests. Kings who had failed to do so had been deposed. It was the king's duty to listen to the counsel of his greater subjects, and to hear in it the voice of local society. He must defend his subjects in war and keep the peace at home; and ensure that the law was respected. That the king himself should observe his own law in his dealings with his subjects was a fundamental principle, enshrined in Magna Carta. Where a king was unjust or partial, public justice must fail, and the will of his subjects to obedience and allegiance would be violated. The consequences of Henry VI's inadequacies as king, of his failure to rule at all, had been a breakdown in both public and private authority and, finally, civil war. A wise king must trust his nobles to rule their regions justly in his name, and keep...</p></p><h2>Down in Orburndale: A Songwriter&#39;s Youth in Old Florida</h2><p><p></p><p>Bobby Braddock, one of the most successful country songwriters of all time, is a living legend. His smash hit "He Stopped Loving Her Today" won the Country Music Association's Song of the Year Award in two consecutive years and was voted "Song of the Century" in a poll conducted by Radio &amp; Records magazine and "greatest country song of all time" in a poll conducted by the BBC. In this captivating narrative, Braddock demonstrates that he is as much at home writing the story of his life as crafting an award-winning country tune. Warm, candid, intimate, and laugh-out-loud funny, Down in Orburndale -- the title plays on the Southern pronunciation of Braddock's hometown of Auburndale, Florida -- recounts his colorful saga up to age twenty-four, when he decides to move to Nashville and pursue a career as a professional songwriter.</p><p>Braddock retains enormous affection for his Florida upbringing, back in the mid-twentieth century when "Florida was still Southern," oranges were more essential than tourists to the state's economy, and every small town seemed to be populated with actual eccentric characters right out of a Southern novel -- like Bobby's father, twenty-four years older than his mother, with a voice that was "a cross between Foghorn Leghorn and W. C. Fields." Braddock's sensory memory of his childhood infuses his storytelling with the sights, sounds, smells, and significance of everyday living. When he tells tales of playing rock 'n' roll music in the Deep South of the early 1960s, readers experience some of the decade's most significant moments from a different perspective (for example, his band was in Birmingham, Alabama, when the Ku Klux Klan murdered four little girls). Along the way, he battles depression, hypochondria, and panic disorder, marries, and finally finds his true calling.</p><p>Rednecks, religion, Florida, oranges, swamps, politics, racism, love, sex, illness, family, murder, and dreams -- all fill the pages of Braddock's compulsively readable ode to his youth. But it is music, above all else, that drives the story, providing a soundtrack for a life lived large.</p></p><p>"Braddock has always amazed me with the way he looks at everyday life. Now, after reading Down in Orburndale, I see that he has no choice but to see life the way he does. How much better off we would all be if we would take the time to absorb the lessons our youth tries to teach us. Braddock is a gifted writer; Down in Orburndale is a gift to us all."--Garth Brooks<p> </p><p>"Character is a pretty rare commodity these days, but it shines forth on every page of Braddock's new memoir, Down in Orburndale. Combined with his great sense of self-deprecating humor and graceful writing style, this makes for a fabulous read, a heady mix of family, fundamentalism, sex, and music. He brings oldtime, small-town Florida back to vivid life as well."--Lee Smith, author of The Last Girls</p><p> </p><p>"This book is like Bobby Braddock himself--funny, honest, intelligent, humble, and absolutely original. Really funny . . . a good-hearted, good-humored account of the artist's journey through the joys and heartbreaks of the creative life. I hope he's already writing the continuing story that picks up where this one stops."--Kris Kristofferson</p><p> </p><p>"Braddock is truly an American original. He can be sincere, clever, witty, charming, and wacky. . . . [Down in Orburndale is] really different and really good--just like Bobby Braddock."--Toby Keith </p><p> "Now the poet who wrote `D-I-V-O-R-C-E' and `He Stopped Loving Her Today' gives us Down in Orburndale, a slantwise portrait of Florida when it was the Old South and Bobby Braddock before he became the songwriter who put the irony in country music. This sweet and bitter tale of the burden of emerging genius is a must read for anyone who loves the South, country music, or crazy people. It is brave, bold, idiosyncratic, and brilliant--pure Braddock."--Alice Randall, author of The Wind Done Gone</p><p>Bobby Braddock grew up in Florida, traveled the South as a rock 'n' roll musician, and became a songwriter in Nashville in the mid-1960s. Many of his songs, such as "D-I-V-O-R-C-E," "Golden Ring," "He Stopped Loving Her Today," "Time Marches On," and "I Wanna Talk about Me" are country music standards. In 2001, he embarked on a new career as a producer, discovering singer Blake Shelton and making several number one records with him.</p></p><h2>The Dragon King: Book 3 of The Crimson Shadow</h2><p>In the third installment of the Crimson Shadow trilogy, the evil King Greensparrow of the land of Eriador seeks revenge, and he takes the form of a mammoth dragon to once again battle Luthien Bedwyr.</p><p>R. A. Salvatore is the acclaimed author of the DemonWars trilogy-The Demon Awakens, The Demon Spirit, and The Demon Apostle-as well asthe New York Times bestseller Vector Prime, an entry in the Star Wars: The New Jedi Order series.Plenty of sound and fury but precious little fire rumbles in the belly of Salvatore's pseudo-Tolkien conclusion to the Crimson Shadow trilogy. Here, Avon's foppish evil wizard-king, Greensparrow, and his dragon alter ego provoke Eriador's wizard-king, Brind'Amour, into breaking the flimsy truce achieved in Luthien's Gamble (Forecasts, Jan. 29). Though badly outnumbered by Avon's "cyclopians," Brind'Amour and his assorted allies assault Avon to free Eriador forever. With the help of Luthien (whose magic alter ego is the Crimson Shadow), Katerin (the Shadow's warrior-maid lover), Siobhan (a revengeful half-elf rape victim), Oliver (a mouthy half-pint "halfting") and a flotilla of nouveau Vikings, the wizard-king slashes through acres of monsters and sloshes through torrents of gore. Despite the rivers of blood, however, Salvatore's vocabulary and imagination prove dry. Supposedly noble characters "smirk," "snicker" and "bat their eyes," and no cliche is left unused: even Saddam Hussein is paraphrased for the coming "grandfather of those battles." Salvatore's tired story depends on gratuitous violence and misused motifs from classic sources (Tolkien's Luthien was a fetching Elf-princess, for example, not a male hero with a fragile ego). These lumbering false steps make Salvatore stumble badly in his attempts to evoke memories of Middle Earth. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gizelle&#39;s Bucket List: My Life with a Very Large Dog (Thorndike Press Large Print Biographies and Memoirs)</h2><p>The playful, epic adventure of a 160-pound English Mastiff and the twentysomething girl who grew up alongside her <i>Marley &amp; Me </i>for a whole new generation. <br>Lauren Watt took her 160-pound English Mastiff to college so of course after graduation, Gizelle followed Lauren to her first, tiny apartment in New York. Because Gizelle wasn t just a dog; she was a roommate, sister, confidante, dining companion, and everything in between. <br>Together, Gizelle and Lauren went through boyfriends, first jobs, a mother s struggle with addiction, and the ups and downs of becoming an adult in the big city. But when Gizelle got sick and Lauren realized her best friend might not be such a constant after all, she designed an epic bucket list to make the absolute most of the time they had left. <br>Bursting with charm, this unique, coming-of-age story of a girl making her way through life is a testament to the special way pets inspire us to live better, love better, and appreciate the simple pleasures. <i>Gizelle s Bucket List</i> is the humorous, poignant lesson our pets teach <i>us: </i>to embrace adventure, love unconditionally, and grow into the people we want to be."</p><p>Lauren Watt was born in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in the suburbs of Nashville, Tennessee. After college, she moved to a tiny New York apartment with her 160-pound English Mastiff, Gizelle. Her first book, <i>Gizelle&#x2019;s Bucket List</i>, has been translated into eleven languages and optioned for film.Gizelle&#x2019;s Bucket List <br>We promised ourselves we were just going to look.<br> <br>Mom and I were sitting in the parking lot of CVS on Franklin Road. It was 10 a.m. and humid already in Brentwood, the suburb of Nashville where I grew up. The windshield faced a line of trees and we were facedown in the The Tennessean classifieds, shopping in our favorite section. The puppy section.<br> <br>We had no business browsing in the puppy section that day. Back home we already had two dogs, Yoda and Bertha, not to mention a slew of other critters and this other unsolvable family problem I doubted the new puppy would know how to fix.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lab?&#x201d; I suggested, biting into my everything bagel.<br> <br>Mom shook her head, mouth full, too. She gave me a thumb up in the air. Bigger!<br> <br>&#x201c;Coonhound?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ehh.&#x201d; She thought it over. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t a coonhound UT&#x2019;s mascot or something, sweetie?&#x201d; She was right. The droopy-eared, jowly coonhound was the mascot of the Vols, the football team at the University of Tennessee where I&#x2019;d be starting as a transfer sophomore in the fall. Would purchasing the mascot be a little too smells-like-team-spirit for the new girl on campus? Having the same thought, our eyes met and we both smiled.<br> <br>Ever since I&#x2019;d come home this summer, Mom had developed a new hankering for facetime in the mornings, suggesting a Starbucks/Bruegger&#x2019;s bakery hit-and-run a few times a week: bagels to go and some super-sugary coffee thing. Then we&#x2019;d park the car in an empty parking lot somewhere just a few miles from a proper kitchen table in our own house, this way we could &#x201c;talk.&#x201d; Just the two of us.<br> <br>And in my mother&#x2019;s case, our talks usually consisted of her apologizing and reminding me she was &#x201c;totally 100 percent fine.&#x201d; Then she would look down at her lap, waiting for my usual: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. It&#x2019;s fine! I believe you.&#x201d; And then we would move on&#x2014;even though it wasn&#x2019;t okay, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure what I believed anymore.<br> <br>My mom was my best friend; of course I wanted to believe her. She wrote me notes in my lunchbox until I graduated high school (sometimes including glitter confetti), told us mermaids were real, bought my little sister, Erisy, and me clothes we didn&#x2019;t need. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell Daddy,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d whisper in her soft, high, lilting voice (the same voice she passed on to me), before hurrying us to our rooms with shopping bags. She approached all things as if they were supposed to be fun, and if there wasn&#x2019;t anything exciting about some detail of life, she&#x2019;d create it.<br> <br>And on this particular Saturday morning, Mom&#x2019;s face lit up with puppy fever. We were sitting in our parked car. Stopped. But it felt like we were in motion. My Frappucino was sweating in its cup holder, the wheels in Mom&#x2019;s head were spinning, no doubt wondering what she could do to make up for last night. She turned her head and looked at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Know what I wanna do today?&#x201d; She leaned in and smiled. &#x201c;We need to get another puppy.&#x201d;<br> <br>She took a sip of her Grande coffee. &#x201c;I really want to get you a big dog. We&#x2019;re big-dog girls. You&#x2019;re such a big-dog girl, sweetie.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t even know what it meant to be a big-dog girl, and I didn&#x2019;t care. I placed my bagel on the dashboard, left the Frappuccino melting, and ran into the CVS to fetch the newspaper.<br> <br>We spread the classifieds across the front of the car, draping the grayish-white pages over our laps and onto the dashboard.<br> <br>German shepherd?<br> <br>Active and sporty, that would be nice. But would a shepherd get along well with our other dogs? We had to consider Yoda and Bertha.<br> <br>Goldendoodle?<br> <br>Beautiful dogs, but we were thinking, like, a big big dog.<br> <br>Great Pyrenees&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Oh! Definitely big, but would that be too much fur?<br> <br>Boxer?<br> <br>We knew boxers intimately, had loved and lost two when I was younger.<br> <br>And just as we were about to call the number on an ad for a husky/lab mix, Mom slammed her finger down onto the newspaper, crinkling it further into her lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;ENGLISH MASTIFF PUPPIES!&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s this saying in the mastiff world, &#x201c;What the lion is to the cat, the mastiff is to the dog.&#x201d; Mastiffs are powerful, gentle, and known for their loyalty. They also happen to be known as the largest dog breed on earth. One Old English mastiff with the name of Aicama Zorba set the record for world&#x2019;s biggest dog at nearly 350 pounds. That&#x2019;s the size of a small donkey. So it&#x2019;s no wonder ancient Greeks and Romans used the mastiff as a war dog. The mastiffs even fought in the Colosseum, next to the gladiators.<br> <br>Mom put the phone on speaker as it rang. I was so excited I was practically holding my breath, hoping someone would pick up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; A woman answered. She sounded very Southern. The word &#x201c;hello&#x201d; sounded like &#x201c;yellow.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom asked if they had a girl.<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>She asked if they had a brindle.<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>Then Mom asked if we could come look (look) at the puppies today.<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>Like, right now?<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>So against all reason and good judgment we hopped on I-65 to look.<br> <br>Our home had always been something of a zoo. Growing up, my brother, sister, and I had every kind of pet a child&#x2019;s heart could desire: furry ones, feathery ones, slimy ones, ones with shells, even one that went oink.<br> <br>If there is an animal-loving gene, I inherited it from my mother. Apparently, when I was little, I would run to the sidewalk after it rained and rescue worms by putting them back in the soil so they didn&#x2019;t dry up. This may sound extreme, but I had nothing on my mother&#x2019;s history with animals.<br> <br>When Mom was a girl (she tells me) she ordered crocodiles from a catalog and put them in her father&#x2019;s bathtub.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we order crocodiles?&#x201d; I used to beg.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, sweetie. It&#x2019;s actually not very nice to the crocodiles. I didn&#x2019;t know better then.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s much of an exaggeration to say my mother had been bringing home animals for over fifty years. Mostly without asking. That&#x2019;s actually how we&#x2019;d gotten our two dogs, Yoda and Bertha&#x2014;on a whim, from the newspaper. Yoda was our Chihuahua at the time. My older brother, Tripp, referred to her as the rat. Sure, she was not much bigger than a guinea pig, and only had five teeth, but I loved her. Yoda&#x2019;s principal canine companion was Bertha, our English bulldog, who looked more like a beached elephant seal mixed with a pig. She had a funny pink tail that curled into her bum like a cinnamon roll, so my brother, sister, and I named it the Cinnabum. At some point she got the nickname Fatty, and that nickname never went away. Fatty preferred not to exercise, had the worst table manners, and snored loudly enough to wake the neighbors. Still, on summer evenings over the sound of the cricket wings chirping from the forest of our backyard, I was known to sit and gaze at Bertha, and sing &#x201c;You Are So Beautiful&#x201d; to her. Fatty was Dad&#x2019;s favorite.<br> <br>You know the couple who gets pregnant, believing somehow that having a baby will save their marriage? This may have been Mom&#x2019;s thinking in us getting a third dog that day. A new dog is a fresh start! It&#x2019;s starting over.<br> <br>So here we were again, starting over&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Two hours later we turned off the exit in Sparta and drove up a long dirt road to a little white house. There was a deep bark booming from the backyard.<br> <br>A woman opened the screen door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Y&#x2019;all here for mastiff puppies? You can come &#x2019;round this way,&#x201d; she said, pointing around to the back.<br> <br>We followed her to the rear of the house, that deep bark getting closer. A long string of deep, sharp woofs with pauses between each one.<br> <br>I started to wonder if this was a good idea after all. I felt a twinge of anger at having been convinced to come on this possibly ridiculous trip. Did Mom really think she could just slap a Band-Aid over her messy slurring drunkenness from last night with a puppy? A puppy is a huge decision. A family decision. Shouldn&#x2019;t we talk to Dad about this? A wave of guilt washed over me as I imagined my parents ignoring each other even more because Mom and I had brought home another animal.<br> <br>We entered the yard and Mom clenched my hand with excitement. The barking grew louder. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s just Dozer!&#x201d; The woman swatted a fly from her face, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind her barkin&#x2019;; she&#x2019;s gentle as butter.&#x201d; But this was unlike any bark I&#x2019;d heard. It was big and loud and ominous, as if she knew we had arrived. My stomach sank. We walked farther until we reached a little pen made of chicken wire.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s two boys an&#x2019; two girls left,&#x201d; the woman told us. Inside the pen was a tangle of four adorable mastiff puppies. Their heads were the size of big grapefruits and their coats were streaked with splotchy black stripes. Underneath the stripes, two were chocolate brown, and the other two were shaded a little lighter, closer to the color of sand. The dark coloring on their faces created the appearance of black masks, and one had a little white patch on her chest. They trotted through the grass with round bellies and thick tails and pawed at each other playfully.<br> <br>I lifted my legs one by one over the wire, sat in the grass, and tried to relax. Mom joined, legs crossed next to me, and as the puppies climbed all over us, Mom&#x2019;s mouth broke into a huge smile. We pianoed our hands under their bellies and let them chew on our shoelaces. Mom buried her nose into their backs, kissing their heads and telling each one it was the cutest thing she&#x2019;d ever seen. I took a deep breath. Slowly, I felt myself softening toward my mother. Maybe this adventure wasn&#x2019;t such a terrible idea after all. The grass was dry like hay but sprinkled with yellow dandelions. When I close my eyes and remember that day, I can see them. Yellow dandelions and a brindle puppy. My puppy.<br> <br>The lady bent over to pick up the puppy, turning it on its back to check for its parts. &#x201c;Here, this one&#x2019;s a girl,&#x201d; she confirmed, and plopped her in my lap. I held her out in front of me with my hands under her armpits. Her skin was too big for her body so it draped over my fingers, and to me this one was so obviously a girl, I couldn&#x2019;t believe the woman had to check. I stared into her eyes and she stared right back. Her wrinkled black forehead and downturned eyes gave her a concerned expression, making her look a tiny bit sad, but I knew she wasn&#x2019;t, because her tail was wagging. She was prettier than a Gerbera daisy. The puppy reached out her wrinkly neck and nibbled my nose. She did this gently&#x2014;delicate and deliberate&#x2014;so her sharp teeth didn&#x2019;t even hurt.<br> <br>Mom squeezed my knee. &#x201c;Lauren. Oh my gosh. We have to get this puppy! Isn&#x2019;t she incredible? Do you want her?&#x201d; She searched my face for a response. Dozer was still barking, and from the corner of my eye I could see her behind a metal gate ten or so yards away. Her head was as big as Darth Vader&#x2019;s, and when she barked, frothy slobber flew from her mouth and globbed on the fence.<br> <br>I held the puppy&#x2019;s warm body to my face and she licked my cheek. That peculiar smell of puppy breath was enough to unzip me. All I wanted was to say yes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, I love her.&#x201d; This was true. But there was a part of me that wanted to say, Let&#x2019;s think about this. Still, I knew if we didn&#x2019;t leave with this precious puppy today, I would never see her again. My mother&#x2019;s eyes were lit with desperation. &#x201c;I want you to have her, honey. It would make me so happy to get her for you. Let me get her for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t really understand my family&#x2019;s dynamics back then, and, frankly, at that point, puppy in lap, who even cared if I was being manipulated? I could have called and asked Dad, but Dad would tell me that impulsive pet buying from the newspaper didn&#x2019;t sound like the best idea. (Rightly so, please don&#x2019;t buy puppies impulsively like this. Also, please consider adopting.)<br> <br>The warm puppy nibbled my nose again and licked my eye, and then licked me again on the mouth. So I swallowed my worries back down and shut the door to the part of my brain that was saying Think of the consequences!<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes! Let&#x2019;s get her!&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom gave the woman $150 cash, then quickly drove to a gas station ATM to take out another $250, and then wrote a check for $300 (we paid for a lot of impulse purchases in this way). I tossed my new friend over my shoulder, thanked the woman very much, gave one last look over to Dozer, and we drove back to Brentwood, one large family member bigger.<br> <br>&#x201c;What should we name her?&#x201d; Mom asked when we were back in the car.<br> <br>I wanted her name to be something sweet and girly, not like the tractor name they&#x2019;d given her mom.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s such a little lady, a princess,&#x201d; I said, squeezing her to my face.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about Please-Dad-don&#x2019;t-get-rid-of-me?&#x201d; my mother laughed, reaching her hand over to pet the puppy&#x2019;s ears.<br> <br>The puppy felt so right in my lap. I looked down at her and couldn&#x2019;t believe this was real. Years later, I&#x2019;d recognize this look as the way a few of my friends gazed at their shiny engagement rings, like they are about to start their lives, like their adventures were about to begin. That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;d felt with the dog in my lap, looking into her marble eyes traced by tiny eyelashes. I felt as though I&#x2019;d fallen under a spell, enchanted. Wait a minute. Enchanted. (I may or may not have watched this Disney musical a million times.)<br> <br>Giselle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom! What about Giselle? Like the princess in Enchanted?&#x201d; Giselle had such a fun ring to it, and based on a lovable naive character it seemed a fit for this innocent puppy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes! That&#x2019;s it. Love that!&#x201d; Mom cheered. We decided to spell it with a z for a little extra spunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Gizelle, hi, girl!&#x201d; I cooed, cradling her in my arms like a doll. (A heftier, pug-sized doll with longer legs.) &#x201c;But what are we telling Dad?&#x201d; I worried, fondling Gizelle&#x2019;s extra neck skin in my hand. Though I knew when it came to this new puppy, he wouldn&#x2019;t be mad. Dad was the most patient person I knew. So he&#x2019;d probably end up nodding his head, as if to say, Of course they brought home another animal, and then he&#x2019;d end up taking care of said animal like he always did, with a minor silent grudge. But he&#x2019;d get over it. Still, Mom wanted to come up with something that would smooth Dad over, just in case. Something that would lessen the shock of a new puppy. (The new puppy that just happens to be the biggest breed in the world.) So we came up with a plan.<br> <br>We pulled up the long driveway to our brick house on the hill. As I headed inside, Dad was in the living room practicing his golf swing in front of the TV. As planned, I greeted him and explained that I rescued a puppy from a place I knew nearby called Noah&#x2019;s Ark Animal Hospital. I told him her adoption was free, and that I was only fostering her until they found her another home. I couldn&#x2019;t just leave her there to die! I couldn&#x2019;t believe I had been so lucky to rescue her just in time! What. A. Miracle!<br> <br>Dad studied me with a puzzled look, club still in hand. Usually, Dad would hand me the nine iron and say, &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, let&#x2019;s see that backswing of yours, Fernie. It&#x2019;s really looking great this year!&#x201d; But he didn&#x2019;t do that. Not today. Instead, he stared down at the size of the huge paws of the puppy cradled in my arms as I worked to pose Gizelle so her adorable head and heart-melting eyes were working for maximum effect. He looked at me again. He didn&#x2019;t channel an angry, &#x201c;No. We have two dogs and a fish and Mom brings home too many pets. Take her back where she came from at once!&#x201d; like a lot of my friends&#x2019; parents would say, and he didn&#x2019;t go the whole, &#x201c;Yes, let&#x2019;s foster her until she gets a fur-ever home! Way to give back, Fernie!&#x201d; route. He just said, &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; drawing out the &#x201c;ay&#x201d; sound at the end, al...</p><h2>The Winter Garden Mystery: A Daisy Dalrymple Mystery</h2><p>The Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, writing about British manor houses, visits Occles Hall and finds it under the charge of the autocratic Lady Valeria, who takes offense when Daisy discovers the body of a pregnant maid buried in the garden.</p><p><p><b>Carola Dunn</b> is the author of several series of novels, including Regency romances, the Daisy Dalrymple mysteries, the Cornish mysteries, and more than two dozen stand-alone novels.</p><p>&#x201c;A charming cozy featuring an intelligent, strong woman.

The excellent diagrams, full-color photographs of specimens, and minor textual changes clarify the concepts (for example, Mohs' scale of hardness) and extend the presentation. Gans barely introduces collecting rocks in the field and organizing and storing them, but the pair of youngsters featured in Keller's brightly colored illustrations certainly convey the joys of being a rock hound.?Carolyn Angus, The Claremont Graduate School, CA<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Scattered Papers of Penelope: New and Selected Poems (Lannan Translation Selection (Graywolf Paperback))</h2><p><p>A career-spanning collection by one of greece's most loved and lyrical contemporary poets, Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke</p><p><b><i>I wasn't weaving, I wasn't knitting </i></b><br><b><i>I was writing something </i></b><br><b><i>erasing and being erased </i></b><br><b><i>under the weight of the word </i></b><br><b> &#x2015;from "Penelope Says" </b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Drawn from the traditions of Greek myth, history, and literature, <i>The Scattered Papers of Penelope </i>is the poet Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke's first full retrospective collection available in English. Carried over from the Greek by an array of noted translators, including the editor, Karen Van Dyck, Anghelaki-Rooke's poetry is bold, sensual, and brash. She reexamines Greek myth and history through the female body&#x2015;the body of Penelope; the poet's own body, scarred by illness; the bodies of stray animals. Other poems and sequences take the form of a journal kept during the first Gulf War, prose poems about modern violence and the destruction of nature, existential musings on beings and things on their own, and lush descriptions of the domestic world on the poet's adopted home island of Aegina. </p><p><i>The Scattered Papers of Penelope </i>introduces to American readers a major global poetic voice, a winner of the Greek National Prize for Poetry and the Greek Academy's Poetry Prize.</p></p><p><p><b>Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke</b> was born in Athens, Greece, in 1939, and is the author of eighteen books of poetry.

She got them. Ruth and her husband, Glen, produced 2 sons and 10 daughters whom they abandoned in 1942, when their marriage collapsed. The boys were grown and gone, but the girls became wards of the state in Mattoon, Illinois, and were subsequently adopted, taken in by grandparents, or sent to the Cunningham Home in Urbana, Illinois. This book is a collective memoir of what happened to those 10 lives during the last 50 years. Now scattered across the country, each daughter has contributed a chapter of recollections in what they call a "personal journal of shared experiences." Although they admit that no attempt was made to produce a "literary work," the women display ingenious writing styles. These are distinct voices reeking with midwestern, self-effacing honesty. In spite of early hardships and a troubled home life, their memories are of square dances, eating watermelon, climbing trees, and the undying affection that has made a family out of 10 not-so-little girls. <i>Patricia Hassler</i></p><h2>Psycho Too</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

He's not overly fond of antiquity, either: during a visit to Jerusalem, the Wailing Wall and the Via Dolorosa strike him, respectively, as �&#x20ac;&#x153;a large pile of breeze blocks and a rather smelly alley.�&#x20ac; (Sometimes his surroundings fight back, as when he's attacked by seagulls in Scotland.) His ramblings sometimes wander into fictional riffs, like an imaginary trip to Bill Gates's house to discuss space-time and an account of �&#x20ac;&#x153;The Great Vomit Wave of '08,�&#x20ac; during which the world's insupportable debt is physically regurgitated. Self's scabrous, amphetamine prose revels in odd details and twisted associations; for him, every map is a Rorschach blot that brings national sexual perversions leaping to mind. (Steadman's evocative illustrations, which look as if Jackson Pollock had dripped on cartoons by Picasso, provide an appropriately demented visual commentary.) Self is far from a reliable tour guide, but his eye for seldom-trod byways and offbeat insights make him a diverting travel companion. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Despommier's stroke of genius, <i>The Vertical Farm</i>, has excited scientists, architects, and politicians around the globe. These farms, grown inside skyscrapers, would provide solutions to many of the serious problems we currently face, including: allowing year-round crop production; providing food to areas currently lacking arable land; immunity to weather-related crop failure; re-use of water collected by de-humidification of the indoor environment; new employment opportunities; no use of pesticides, fertilizers, or herbicides; drastically reduced dependence on fossil fuels; no crop loss due to shipping or storage; no agricultural runoff; and, many more. Vertical farming can be located on abandoned city properties, creating new urban revenue streams. They will employ lots of skilled and unskilled labor. They can be run on wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal energy. They can be used to grow plants for pharmaceutical purposes or for converting gray water back into drinking water. In the tradition of the bestselling <i>The World Without Us</i>, this is a totally original landmark work destined to become a classic.

Readers will learn not only how to make a delicious Passover Seder, but why each dish is prepared for this annual celebration, and where these recipes originated. The 260-plus recipes vary from classic Jewish favorites to brand new discoveries with international flair. <b>The New Jewish Holiday Cookbook</b> is a wonderful resource for chefs, whether they are preparing their very first Hanukkah feast or putting the finishing touches on the weekly Sabbath dinner.</p><p>Gloria Kaufer Greene has been the food editor of the <i>Baltimore Jewish Times</i> since 1981. She lives in Columbia, MarylandJewish cookbooks have become a rapidly burgeoning category. Appearing at the beginning of the annual cycle that starts with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, three of these four new titles focus on Jewish holidays and holy days, while Friedland's concentrates just on the Sabbath. Greene's book, a revision of her 1985 title, is by far the most ambitious of the group, with more than 250 recipes (80 or so entirely new, the others thoroughly revised) for all the major holidays and some minor ones, and including Israel's Independence Day as well as religious celebrations. A cooking teacher and the longtime food editor of the Baltimore Jewish Times, Greene also offers extensive background on each holiday, and her diverse recipes are from all around the globe. Highly recommended. Recently, a growing number of Jews have found themselves returning to their religious roots and observances they have let lapse, making Friedland's book on celebrating the Sabbath particularly timely. A cookbook editor and author of The Passover Cookbook, Friedland presents 175 recipes for the three meals of Shabbat (Friday dinner, Saturday lunch, and the "third meal," marking the end of the Sabbath later on Saturday). Like Greene's, her recipes are international in scope, reflecting both the Ashkenazic and Sephardic heritages, and her text is readable and informative. Recommended for most collections. Brownstein, the former art director of Good Housekeeping and House Beautiful, offers a lavishly illustrated crafts book with recipes and ideas for the holidays. For each holiday, there is a menu, several crafts projects, and decorating suggestions. Brownstein's approach will not be to everyone's taste (the three sukkahs for Sukkot, for example, include a "fantasy" Penthouse Sukkah, "high-tech and sleek," but the minimatzo vases for the Passover seder are pretty cute). For larger collections. Rubin seems like a nice woman, but would her cookbooks have been published if she weren't actor/singer Mandy Patinkin's mother? Her second book, which opens with "testimonials" from grandchildren and other family members, includes recipes for Thanksgiving, a bridal luncheon, and a barbecue as well as for four major Jewish holidays. The recipes are simple, and many of them rely on convenience foods; some have little to do with traditional Jewish holiday cooking (the buffet menu includes Mexicali Layered Dip and two shellfish dishes). Only for collections where Rubin's Grandma Doralee Patinkin's Jewish Family Cookbook is popular. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Translations from Drawing to Building and Other Essays</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Chang'an Avenue, named after China's ancient capital (whose name means "Eternal Peace"), is supremely symbolic. Running east-west through the centuries-old heart of Beijing, it intersects the powerful north-south axis that links the traditional centers of political and spiritual legitimacy (the imperial Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven). Among its best-known features are Tiananmen Square and the Great Hall of the People, as well as numerous other monuments and prominent political, cultural, financial, and travel-related institutions. Drawing on Chang'an Avenue's historic ties and modern transformations, this study explores the deep structure of the Chinese modernization project, providing both a big picture of Beijing's urban texture alteration and details in the design process of individual buildings.<br><br>Political winds shift, architectural styles change, and technological innovations influence waves of demolition and reconstruction in this analysis of Chang'an Avenue's metamorphosis. During collective design processes, architects, urban planners, and politicians argue about form, function, and theory, and about Chinese vs. Western and traditional vs. modern style. Every decision is fraught with political significance, from the 1950s debate over whether Tiananmen Square should be open or partially closed; to the 1970s discussion of the proper location, scale, and design of the Mao Memorial/Mausoleum; to the more recent controversy over whether the egg-shaped National Theater, designed by the French architect Paul Andreu, is an affront to Chinese national pride.</p><p><b>Shuishan Yu </b>is associate professor of art history at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan."There is no comparable book in a Western language, and <i>Chang'an Avenue</i> goes farther in its vision than any comparable book in Chinese. Focusing on China's most important locus, Tian'anmen and the Forbidden City behind it, and modern China's most important street, Chang'an Avenue, it explains how architecture was integral to China's attempt to define a socialist, sometimes totalitarian, and ultimately people's republican state from the rapidly changing world of the 1950s through the Beijing Olympics."&#x2015;Nancy Steinhardt, author of <i>Chinese Imperial City Planning</i></p><h2>Dangerous Friend: The Teacher-Student Relationship in Vajrayana Buddhism</h2><p>Although Tibetan Buddhism continues to grow in popularity, the crucial relationship between teacher and student remains largely misunderstood. <i>Dangerous Friend </i> offers an in-depth exploration of this mysterious and complex bond, a relationship of paramount importance in Tibetan Buddhist practice. <br><br>According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the student must have complete trust in the teacher (the "dangerous friend") if he or she is to achieve any understanding. It is the teacher's responsibility to uphold the integrity of the tradition, the basis of which is compassion for all beings, by transmitting it properly to an appropriate student. Likewise, it is the student's responsibility to meet the challenge of carrying on the lineage of teachings. By entering such a relationship, both teacher and student accept the burden of protecting those teachings by understanding them completely and correctly, by practicing them fully and faultlessly, and by transmitting them without omission. <br><br> <i>Dangerous Friend </i> includes discussions of the following topics: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Meeting and recognizing an appropriate teacher. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Understanding the gravity of entering the teacher-student relationship. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Shifting one's approach from spiritual materialism to genuine Buddhist practice. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Accepting the challenge of being truly kind, honest, and courageous.</p><p>Rig&#39;dzin Dorje is a practitioner and teacher in the Nyingma School of Vajrayana Buddhism.

Yet signs are complex pieces of design, serving not only as physical markers but also as cultural, political, and economic ones. In <i>American Signs</i>, Lisa Mahar traces the evolution of motel signs on Route 66 in a distinctive visual approach that combines text, images, and graphics.<br><br> <i>American Signs</i> reveals the rich vernacular traditions of motel sign-making in five eras, spanning from the late 1930s through the 1970s. The motel signs of the early 1940s, for instance, reflect vernacular traditions dating back at least a century, while examples from the later years of the decade reveal a culture newly obsessed with themes. America's fascination with newness and technological progress is manifested in 1950s motel signs. Finally, in the 1960s, a turn toward simplicity and the use of new, modular technologies allowed motel signs to address the needs of a mass society and the beginnings of a national, rather than regional, aesthetic for motel signs.</p><p>Lisa Mahar is a cofounder and partner in the New York architecture and design firm MAP.

A journey which begins at the foot of the Benjamin Franklin statue in San Francisco's Washington Square, which wanders through the wonders of America's rural waterways, and which ends, inevitably, with mayonnaise. Funny, wild, and sweet,<i> Trout Fishing in America</i> is an incomparable guidebook to the delights of exploration -- both of land and mind. <br><br> Richard Brautigan was a literary idol of the 1960s and 1970s whose comic genius and iconoclastic vision of American life caught the imagination of young people everywhere. His early books became required reading for the hip generation, and on its publication, <i>Trout Fishing in America</i>, considered by many as his best novel, became an international bestseller.With it Brautigan caught the public's attention and became a cult hero. By 1970 <i>Trout Fishing in America </i>had become the namesake of a commune, a free school, an underground newspaper, and more. <br><br></p><p><b>Richard Brautigan</b> (1935-1984) was a literary idol of the 1960s and 1970s whose comic genius and iconoclastic vision of American life caught the imagination of young people everywhere. He was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, and moved to San Francisco in the mid-1950s when he became involved in the emerging beat scene. During the 1960s, he became one of the most prominent and prolific writers of the counterculture. Out of this period came some of his most famous works, the best known of which are <i>Trout Fishing in America</i>; his collection of poetry, <i>The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster</i>; and his collection of stories, <i>Revenge of the Lawn</i>. Translated the world over, his works helped establish him as one of the most significant American writers of his generation. As his popularity waned towards the end of the 1970s, he became increasingly disillusioned about his work and his life. He committed suicide in 1984. He was the author of eleven novels, ten volumes of poetry, a collection of short stories, and miscellaneous nonfiction pieces, works that often employed parody, satire, and black comedy.<br><br>''There are a number of creek fishing sequences in this book which read as if Henry Miller had decided to learn about fishing from Hemingway but which will not likely amuse fisherman...The effect is more like that of a collection of newspaper columns...At times Brautigan can achieve absurdity which is Homeric...This book ought to be required reading in hippie pads.'' --<i>Los Angeles Free Press</i><br><br>''A book infused with a bucolic surrealism and mournful psychedelia that has very little to do with trout fishing and a lot to do with the lamenting of a passing pastoral America...An instant cult classic.'' --<i>Financial Times (London)</i></p><h2>Instructor&#39;s and Counselor&#39;s Guide for Career Choices : An Interdisciplinary Curriculum for High Schools and College</h2><p>Never Opened.

Like her penchant for stealing, her use of dangerous additives to create her so-called all-natural fibers, and a scheming mind that had made her more than one enemy. Now Betsy must wring the truth from a bevy of colorful suspects.

She lives in Minnesota.&nbsp;Ferris&#x2019; long running Needlecraft series continues with the story of the murder of Hailey Brent, talented yarn dyer. After offering a dye class at Betsy Devonshire&#x2019;s craft store, Hailey is found dead among her pots and dyes. Gardener friend Marge, whom the police pinpoint as a suspect, asks amateur-sleuth Betsy to find out who really killed Hailey. Betsy quickly learns that Hailey had some bad habits, which angered a lot of people, making it difficult to pinpoint the person with the strongest motive. Betsy and her many friends continue to be vivid, likable characters, and the mystery is intricate enough to keep readers guessing. The needlework details will interest fans but do not overpower the plot. In a nice departure from cozy formula, Ferris injects a bit of realism into the genre by showing how hard it is for amateur sleuths to get people to talk.

It aims to be a practical work, showing the &#34;evolution&#34; of the fence from the road barrier of logs, brush or sods to the latest improved forms of barbed mire. The numerous illustrations are mainly representations of fences, gates, etc., in actual use. The chapter on fence law is necessarily condensed. The various judicial decisions upon the subject alone would fill a large volume.

The author delivers a lively account of her return to "a place that as a young woman I had gladly left behind." A naturalist and activist, Ray writes eloquently about the region's forests and waterways, places she works to protect from annihilation. She's also a community advocate and embraces rural traditions. In episodic vignettes, Ray tells of attending a syrup boiling, judging a pork cook-off and struggling to keep her son's small school open. Neighbors, cousins and assorted eccentrics populate the narrative, and Ray's affectionate portraits of them are memorable: her uncle Percy, who mows grass and attends church "with great joy"; her brother and his efforts to grow a giant tomato; and the photographer who lives in an old school bus. The eponymous quilt appears throughout the book, serving as a metaphor for Ray's attempt to reassemble her life. "Making a quilt is about being able to talk," she writes. "[T]rying to create a beautiful thing... mother and daughter, in spite of our differences." Though she doesn't delve into her relationship with her son and barely addresses the issue of race and contact with local black people, Ray celebrates the richness of the natural world and the comforts of family.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ray described her hardscrabble rural Georgia childhood and her journey out into a wider world in her acclaimed first book, <i>Ecology of a Cracker Childhood</i> (1999). But just as she had to leave home to become the writer and environmental activist she is, Ray had to return to put into practice her belief in the value of rural communities. In neatly fashioned and wonderfully anecdotal linked essays she chronicles her move into her grandmother's old farmhouse with her young son, and her attempt to create a meaningful life in a land where magnificent longleaf pine forests have been replaced with tree plantations, family farms sold, and small towns driven nearly to extinction. As she recounts her homesteading adventures and quilting sessions with her mother, and shares her love of nature with equal measures of lyricism and humor, Ray explains why she believes that rural life is just as important and worthy of protection as wilderness and wildlife. Not only is her book quiltlike, her entire endeavor is also a form of quilt making as she rescues discarded ways of life, seeks to create wholeness out of fragments, and concocts vibrant patterns of living that combine tradition and innovation and make way for beauty. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now, more than 35 years later, <i>Joel Meyerowitz: Cape Light</i> is back. This edition features all the now-iconic images, newly remastered and luxuriously printed in a larger format. In <i>Cape Light</i>, everyday scenes&#x2014;an approaching storm, a local grocery store at dusk, the view through a bedroom window&#x2014;are transformed by the stunning natural light of Cape Cod and the luminous vision of the photographer. Though Meyerowitz had begun shooting in color on the streets of New York a decade earlier, it was this collection of photographs that brought his sensitive color photography to wider notice. Meyerowitz is a contemporary master of color photography, and this powerful, captivating photobook is a classic of the genre.</p><p>Joel Meyerowitz is an award-winning photographer whose work has appeared in over 350 exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world. He is a two-time Guggenheim Fellow, a recipient of both National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities awards, and a recipient of the Deutscher Fotobuchpreis. He has published over fifteen books and lives between Italy and New York.The images in <i>Cape Light</i> have been newly remastered and printed, and remind us of Meyerowitz&#x2019;s uncanny ability to capture epiphanies amid the beaches, diners and streets of Cape Cod. &#x2013; <i>Royal Photographic Society Journal</i><br>The publishing of <i>Cape Light</i> decades ago was an inspiration, a revelation of refined color and simplicity at a time when black and white was considered the standard for serious photography. Although the incongruence of a large format view camera and seizing fast moving life in Provincetown was an anomaly&#x2014;and daring&#x2014;it also revealed the marvelously nuanced color captured at the Cape. Joel Meyerowitz succeeded best in the way that he recorded porches at dusk, long stretches of beach with an approaching storm, and quiet portraits. &#x2013;<i>New York Journal of Books</i><br>Thirty-five years ago, these photographs broke new ground in how film in an 8&#x201d; x 10&#x201d; view camera could reproduce the colors and intensity of light, making color photography more accepted in the art world. &#x2013;<i>Travel and Leisure</i><br>Meyerowitz&#x2019;s photographs are acclaimed for their use of color and their appreciation of light, which transform everyday scenes of homes, beaches, and streets into something otherworldly. &#x2013;<i>Slate</i><br>More than 35 years since its first publication, <i>Cape Light</i> doesn&#x2019;t look like a time capsule of a bygone place but rather an enduring distillation of its timeless spirit. &#x2013;<i>Slate</i></p><h2>Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of Kevin Mitnick, America&#39;s Most Wanted Computer Outlaw - By the Man Who Did It</h2><p>The dramatic true story of the capture of the world's most wanted cyberthief by brilliant computer expert Tsutomu Shimomura, describes Kevin Mitnick's long computer crime spree, which involved millions of dollars in credit card numbers and corporate trade secrets.

Given all of the hype surrounding the capture of Kevin Mitnick (much of it created and sustained by the authors of this book), one would at least expect the version provided by "The Man Who Did It" to be entertaining. But Tsutomu Shimomura's writing (apparently not assisted enough by John Markoff) is somewhat dull. The details of Shimomura's personal life are probed in depth while technical, legal, and ethical questions are brushed over without commentary, such as the supposed proof of Mitnick's involvement in the break-in or Markoff's involvement in the capture. There may be some material of interest to the enthusiast, and those who read Jonathan Littman's <i>The Fugitive Game</i> should at least check out <i>Takedown</i> to see what all of the fuss is about.</p>Computer security expert Shimomura gained instant celebrity with his highly publicized capture of Kevin Mitnick, a notorious computer hacker who allegedly plundered the Internet at will, stealing files and information from computer systems throughout the world. Markoff, a new breed of cyberspace journalist, was the sole reporter present when Mitnick was arrested, invited by Shimomura to cover the bust. Markoff's account of this story first appeared on the front page of the New York Times on February 16, 1995, the day after the bust. Markoff and Shimomura were friends, and Markoff's previous book, Cyberpunk (LJ 6/1/91), devoted a third of its content to the nefarious Mitnick. Takedown is a riveting account of the investigation and capture of a skilled hacker by a brilliant cybersleuth. Littman, an investigative reporter, has also written a compelling narrative of the Mitnick case. In contrast to Takedown, Littman captures Mitnick's side of the story. He focuses on Mitnick's motives and ambitions, drawing on personal conversations and correspondence with the world-class hacker while he was still a fugitive. Littman alleges questionable motives on the part of Shimomura and Markoff as they tread the murky water of journalistic ethics surrounding book advances, movie deals, talk-show appearances, and speaking fees. He exposes a conflict of interest raised by the financial rewards Shimomura and Markoff received by cooperating with the FBI, and asserts that the ensuing publicity over Internet security and the need for tougher laws distracted us from the real issue of a constitutional right to privacy on the information superhighway. Most libraries should have both The Fugitive Game and Takedown.<br><i>-?Joe Accardi, Northeastern Illlinois Univ.

This time Milo&#39;s trying to find his feet in Texas, earning a living as a bar owner and a PI on the side.A tedious job tracking down a runaway wife takes a violent turn when he finds himself in a bar with ex-con Enos Walker, who&#39;s out for revenge on the partners who turned him in. Turning a gun on Walker, bar manager Billy Long has accidently shot himself and the police are only too keen to add his murder to the long list of crimes Walker&#39;s in the frame for. Only Milo&#39;s testimony can save him from a death sentence, but Milo&#39;s got problems of his own in the shape of sultry lawyer Molly McBride.Hurtling from the plains of Texas to the desert town of Las Vegas, from the freezing Montana mountains to the Gulf of Mexico and the final bloody showdown, The Final Country is a non-stop roller-coaster ride that will leave you breathless.</p><p>It's been too long since James Crumley's last Milo Milodragovitch adventure, but the wait was worth it. <i>The Final Country</i> is a fully satisfying read with plenty of action, even more sex, and superb characterization.<p> "A chase after money and revenge had brought me to Texas, and a woman had kept me here," Milo explains. But trying to salvage a love affair, keep his PI business going, and run a tavern (whose real business is laundering drug money) hasn't kept trouble from following Milo--or maybe it's the other way around. When a man kills a drug dealer right in front of him, Milo can't help but track the shooter down, if only to keep the Texas cops from railroading him into the death chamber. Soon one beautiful woman frames Milo for the murder of a well- connected Texan, and another one with ties to both killings disappears, setting up the intricately plotted action of this fast-paced thriller.</p><p> Crumley's narrative gifts and poetic talents set this crazy-funny mystery apart. Milo is a consistently interesting protagonist, especially here, as Crumley depicts him in the fullness of middle age, a hard-boiled, bruised, and battered dick who, despite all evidence to the contrary, still believes in the redemptive powers of love--not to mention liquor, cocaine, and sex. Texas may not be Milo's natural habitat, but it's a big enough backdrop for his unique talents, and for Crumley's, too. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>James Crumley was born in Three Rivers, Texas, and spent most of his childhood in South Texas.

The spare poetry of this book lovingly captures details of Christ's birth, like the smell of hay, the sounds of the animals inside the manger, and Mary's contented sigh as she holds her son in her arms. Then time stands still as viewers see the large, sweet face of "this tiny baby boy" being adored by visitors in the silence. As the picture pans out onto the rural landscape of the first Christmas night, the scene conveys an overarching sense of peace. Low's gorgeous use of dark colors serves to highlight the luminous glow of the angels, stars, and baby Jesus, setting the ideal mood for this lyrical meditation on the Christmas story.

Wrede lives in Edina, Minnesota.Wrede's ( Caught in Crystal ) romantic and charming retelling of the Brothers Grimm tale is the fourth in this series. In the village of Mortlak, near the river Thames, during the reign of Elizabeth I, live the Widow Arden and her two daughters, Blanche and Rosamund. The widow, who supports her family by selling herbs and making healing potions, lives in fear of being accused of witchcraft. Her daughters gather the herbs she needs, sometimes crossing into the realm of Faerie, one of whose borders lies in the forest nearby. Also residing in Mortlak is the real-life Doctor Dee, astrologer to the Queen, who with his friend Edward Kelly seeks to harness the magic of Faerie. Their efforts turn Hugh, one of the half-human sons of the queen of Faerie, into a bear. With the aid of the widow and her daughters, John, the elder Faerie prince, tries to disenchant his brother, who has crossed over to the mortal world. John is initially thwarted in his efforts by Madini, head of a faction in Faerie that seeks complete separation from the mortal domain. In putting her twist on the classic tale, Wrede uses language appropriate to the period and nicely evokes both medieval England and a magic land. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fine Art of Fundraising: Secrets for Successful Volunteers</h2><p>Carolyn Farb's tried-and-true tips will motivate longtime fundraisers to continue in their endeavors and draw new fundraisers into the fold.<br>Carolyn Farb knows the world of fundraising from the bottom floor to the executive suites &#x2014; and in <i>The Fine Art of Fundraising,</i> she gives readers the complete tour.

But have they finally met their match with the Jurassic Jack Rabbits from Jupiter?<br><br>It's Ricky Ricotta's birthday, and as a special treat, his parents are taking him and his Mighty Robot to see dinosaurs at the museum. Too bad they've also invited Ricky's little cousin Lucy--she's a real pest! When they get to the museum, all the dinosaurs are missing their heads . . . because an evil spacebunny from Jupiter has used the dino DNA to create Jurassic Jack Rabbits! Now it's up to the entire Ricotta family, including Lucy, to stop them from taking over the planet. With their easy-to-read language and action-packed pictures, the Ricky Ricotta books are ideal for beginning readers.</p><p>Dav Pilkey hits the halfway mark in this cheerfully ridiculous, easy-reader series that spans the solar system, as Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot takes on the Jurassic Jackrabbits from Jupiter.<p> Little Ricky (a smart young mouse, for those of you just joining us) is having a birthday, and that's cause for some serious robotic celebration. The family--along with cousin Lucy ("a little PEST!")--piles on top of the Mighty Robot for a trip to see dino skeletons at the local museum. Unfortunately, General Jackrabbit, evil ruler of Jupiter's "billions of carrot-loving jackrabbits" (the carrots make the planet orange, you see), has other plans for our heroes. He's hoping to take over Earth, but he knows that first he's got to take down Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot. And how better to accomplish that than using the museum's dino skeletons, some of the General's own DNA, and a Meany Machiney to create three big, mean Jurassic Jackrabbits?</p><p> There's no doubt that Pilkey can be much funnier when he has more words to work with--witness any of the Captain Underpants books (and Ricky Ricotta is no George or Harold)--but this series at least gives younger readers something fun to do while working on their reading chops. And, of course, you don't have to read a single word to thoroughly enjoy Flip-o-Rama, Pilkey's "world-famous cheesy animation technique," which lets readers flip pages back and forth to animate the action.

Washington</p> <p>Growing up, I knew for an absolute fact that no one on the planet was stronger than my mother. So when she told me stories of who she admired growing up, I paid attention. She was clearly in awe of her grandmother Emily. She described her grandmother as iron-willed and devilish, physically beautiful and demanding of beauty from others, determined to make her farmhouse in central Louisiana a fun place to be on Sundays when family gathered, and fanatical and unforgiving about the responsibilities generated from family ties.</p> <p>My mother drew parallels between her grandmother Emily and Jacqueline Kennedy. "Emily was class," she would say, describing her physical attributes: her long, graceful neck, her tiny, tiny waist. "Emily was class, Emily was elegant,<em> just like </em>Jackie." </p> <p>How my mother came by this first-name familiarity with the president's wife I couldn't begin to imagine, but as I grew older and listened carefully to other stories about my great-grandmother Emily that was the least of my bafflement. The pieces wouldn't fit. On the one hand, Emily, refined, graceful, elegant, soft-spoken, classy. On the other, Emily, a woman from the backwoods of Louisiana, possibly born a slave right before the Civil War, unapologetic about dipping snuff, buzzed on her homemade muscadine wine each and every day. Not exactly "<em>just like Jackie</em>."</p> <p>Emily intrigued me, and, the puzzle of this woman simmered on the back burner of my conscious mind for decades, undoubtedly triggering questions about who I was as well. Not until 1995 did that the search really started to heat up, for the simple reason that I was no longer gainfully employed and suddenly had massive quantities of time on my hands. I had been a corporate executive, Vice President and General Manager of Sun Microsystems in Silicon Valley, when I decided to change my life by stepping off into the great unknown. I quit my job. Not a sabbatical. No looking back or second guessing. Just walked away.</p> <p> "When does your new job start?" asked my mother. Actually, what I heard was, "How could you possibly walk away from a good job you got only because I sacrificed to put you through school and by the way, I spent fourteen hours in labor to get you here in the first place." She didn't really say the last part, at least not out loud, but that is what it <em>felt </em>like she said.</p> <p>"I refuse to take a job for at least a year," I replied, trying to sound confident. "I need to listen to the silence, find the inner me, reengineer myself outside of the confines of corporate America."</p> <p>My mother had no patience with this drivel. "Who's going to pay you to do that?"<br> "I've saved enough for a year or two."<br> "Can you get your old job back?"<br> "I don't want my old job. It's gone. There's something else I'm supposed to be doing," I said. <br> "I just don't know what it is yet." <br> "You're supposed to have a job."</p> <p>I let the silence build. For some things, there is no response. "So what are you going to do for the next year?" she pushed. <br> <br> Here was the critical moment where a persuasive argument could win her to my side, put her mind to rest, reassure her of my ability to adapt.<br> <br> "I don't know," I said, which unbeknownst to me would become my mantra of the next few years.</p> <p>I couldn't explain it because I didn't understand it, but I felt compelled to leave my job and research my ancestry. Gradually, and then overwhelmingly, I slipped into the dark, shadowy, addictive parallel universe of genealogy. Entire days disappeared from my life when I entered the bowels of the National Archives to pore over census records. Secretive trips to Louisiana to chase down fragile leads in local courthouses, newspaper archives and libraries followed. I began to lie to my friends, telling them I was "just relaxing, taking it easy, enjoying my newfound free time."</p> <p>Meanwhile, the relentless search for dead relatives consumed weeks and then months. I lost all sense of shame, carrying tape recorders into nursing homes to interview people who couldn't remember what they had for breakfast but could spin sharp tales of events from eighty years ago. I craved one more fact, one more connection, one more story, but one was never enough. I had to have more, to know more about the people in my family, dead for a hundred years. I was hooked.</p> <p>So hooked, I traced my mother's line to a place in Louisiana called Cane River, a unique area that before the Civil War housed one of the largest and wealthiest collections of free people of color in the United States. I decided to hire a specialist on Cane River culture, a genealogist who could read the Creole French records that I could not. The task I assigned her was to find my great-grandmother Emily's grandmother.</p> <p> "Let's get the facts we know on the table, starting with her name," the genealogist said.<br> "I don't know." (The mantra echoed.) <br> "No first name or last name?"<br> "No." <br> "Okay. Was she from Cane River?" <br> "Maybe," I said encouragingly. <br> "Her daughter was." <br> "Okay. Was she slave or free?"<br> "I don't know. I can't find any trace of her in the free census records, but I'm not sure."</p> <p> The genealogist seemed doubtful, but she took the job anyway. I was, after all, paying her by the hour just to look.</p> <p>No job, no paycheck, so how long could this foolish obsession to find my unnamed great-great-great-great grandmother last? Turns out, for eighteen months, by the hour, until the genealogist recovered a document that banished any doubt I would write a historical novel based on the characters revealed. In a collection of ten-thousand unindexed local records written in badly preserved Creole French, she found the bill of sale for my great-great-greatgreat- grandmother Elisabeth, who was sold in 1850 in Cane River, Louisiana, for eight-hundred dollars.</p> <p> I wondered whether my great-great-great-great-grandmother spent as much time envisioning her descendants as I had spent envisioning her life. I held the bill of sale in my hands, awed and humbled, curious what any one of the women who came before me, born slaves, would think of one of their own having the opportunity to become an executive at a Fortune 500 company. Could any of them have even dreamed of that possibility in 1850 as they changed hands at auction from one property owner to another? I wondered what they would think of the world we live in today. What would Elizabeth have thought of my quitting my job and spending far more than her selling price to find any evidence she had existed?</p> <p>At this point, I had no choice. I had to write their story and document their lives - my history. They were, after all, real flesh-and-blood people. I pieced their lives the best I could from over a thousand documents uncovered in my years of research, re-creating what life must have been like for them during the 1800s and 1900s. The result was Cane River, a novelized account covering one-hundred years in America's history and following four generations of Creole slave women in Cane River, Louisiana, as they struggled to keep their families intact through the dark days of slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the pre-civil rights era of Jim Crow South.</p> <p>The rest - the dog-work of writing the novel, finding an agent, finding a publisher and doing the book tour - was as grueling and exciting as discovering my ancestry. Within days of being sent to several publishers, Warner Books purchased the novel. Once again, my family was on the auction block but this time in a more satisfying way, honoring instead of dishonoring. Things had certainly changed over the last hundred and fifty years. I wished I could show my great-great-great-great-grandmother Elisabeth the price our family commanded this time.</p> <p>Three months after the publication of Cane River, the phone rang as I was packing for yet another book-signing trip. <br> <br> "Hello, this is Oprah."<br> "Yeah, right!" I said, wondering which of my friends was playing this cruel practical joke. I waited for laughter that never came. <br> "This is Oprah," the distinct and ever-so-familiar voice said again.</p> <p>As recognition registered, I mustered my most professional corporate voice in the midst of my total embarrassment and surprise. "Hello, Ms. Winfrey. What can I do for you today?"

Wells is generally credited with the popularisation of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term &#34;time machine&#34;, coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle. This work is an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre. The portion of the novel that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places The Time Machine within the realm of Eschatology; that is the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of mankind. The Time Machine has since been adapted into two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media.</p><p>Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses. By using a running English-to-Spanish thesaurus at the bottom of each page, this edition of The Time Machine by H.G. Wells was edited for three audiences. The first includes Spanish-speaking students enrolled in an English Language Program (ELP), an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) program, an English as a Second Language Program (ESL), or in a TOEFL� or TOEIC� preparation program. The second audience includes English-speaking students enrolled in bilingual education programs or Spanish speakers enrolled in English speaking schools. The third audience consists of students who are actively building their vocabularies in Spanish in order to take foreign service, translation certification, Advanced Placement� (AP�) or similar examinations. By using the Webster's Spanish Thesaurus Edition when assigned for an English course, the reader can enrich their vocabulary in anticipation of an examination in Spanish or English. TOEFL�, TOEIC�, AP� and Advanced Placement� are trademarks of the Educational Testing Service which has neither reviewed nor endorsed this book. All rights reserved.In The Time Machine Wells pioneers the concept of travel in the &#39;Fourth Dimension&#39; and speculates about the ultimate decay of the human species. The world of the effete Eloi and ape-like Morlocks, the age of giant crabs, and the final portrayal of the heat-death of the sun constitute an unforgettable vision of the future. The Time Traveller&#39;s narrow escape from the remote descendants of humanity is paralleled by Edward Prendick&#39;s horrifying adventures among the Beast Folk of The Island of Doctor Moreau. Moreau, a ruthless vivisector, chooses an uninhabited Pacific island for his attempts to change animals into human beings on the operating table. Prendick soon fears that he, too, may become a victim of Moreau&#39;s experiments. Even at their most bleakly pessimistic and ironic, these stories testify to the resources of human courage and ingenuity. This edition offers authoritative texts of both novels, explanatory notes, and an introduction setting them in the context of Wells&#39;s life and thought.</p><h2>The Septuagint (Understanding the Bible and Its World)</h2><p><p>Jennifer Dines provides an introductory survey of current scholarship on the Greek Bible - the Septuagint. She outlines its origins in the third to first centuries BCE, going on to trace its subsequent history to the fifth century CE. The Septuagint's relationship with the standard Hebrew text and its translational characteristics are examined, as is its value as a collection with its own literary and exegetical character. </p><p>The Septuagint is shown to be an important source for biblical studies (both Old and New Testament), to make a distinctive contribution to the history of biblical interpretation, and to be of considerable interest for understanding the early development of both Judaism and Christianity.</p></p><p>Jennifer Dines is Research Associate in the AHRB Parkes Centre Project, &#34;The Greek Bible in the Graeco-Roman World.&#34; She is also a member of the Strasburg-based team preparing the Amos volume of the &#39;Bible d&#39;Alexandrie&#39;.&#x201c;The Septuagint or early Greek translation of the Old Testament has lacked a good, current introduction until recently. The strength of Dr. Dines&#x2019;s introduction is its thoroughness, compactness, and readability. The user-friendly layout, with sub-headings and sections clearly indicated, and the detailed table of contents and indexes all make this an easy volume to read and also to consult and refer to for the answer to specific questions. It has one of the most comprehensive discussions on Septuagint origins that I have seen. The treatment of topics, even the controversial ones, is balanced and judicious. I do not believe the student can do better for a guide to the Septuagint, and working biblical scholars and even Septuagint specialists will also want it on their bookshelf.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lester L. Grabbe, Professor of Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism, University of Hull (Lester L. Grabbe)<br><br>&#x201c;Her summary of scholarly positions is good and her criticisms even better...this enjoyable introduction by a highly qualified and well-balanced LXX scholar will fill a need. The work contains three handy indices and a seventeen-page bibliography, and for use as a textbook it has the added attraction of the Hebrew and Greek always being transliterated...it will serve not only as an introductory guide for Septuagint courses proper, but due to its small size it can easily be used as a secondary text in courses on Hellenistic Judaism, New Testament/Christian origins.&#x201d; &#x2013;Review of Biblical Literature, June 2005 (<i>Review of Biblical Literature</i>)<br><br>'If you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to the Septuagint, this book is just that.

The stories, which take place in various locales-Africa, Australia, Italy-and in periods from the 1950s and '60s to today, explore the timeless, intricate dance of love and courtship, and make wise, often compassionate observations.

Musical notation is included. Full color.</p><p><i> "I'm a little white duck <br> sitting in the water, <br> a little white duck <br> doing what he oughter." <br> </i><p> Children have sung this silly song written by Walt Whippo and Bernard Zaritzky for half a century. Performers from Burl Ives to Danny Kaye to Raffi have recorded it over the years. And now, for the first time, the classic sing-along song about the duck that "quack, quack, quacks," the frog that "glug, glug, glugs," and the bug that "bzz, buzz, bzz's" has made its way into picture-book format. Joan Paley's gorgeous collages are full of vivacious color and three-dimensional pizzazz. Bold, brilliant greens and blues dominate, drawing the reader deeper and deeper into the happy little world of these water critters--happy, that is, until the little red snake comes along and scares off the duck and frog and eats the bug! But <i>he's</i> still glad to be "a little red snake playing in the water," so all's well that ends well. To soften the blow of the untimely demise of the little black bug, all four of the characters (duck, frog, bug, snake), plus the guitar-strumming mouse narrator, take a bow on the last page, so sensitive young readers will know it's all just play-acting.

Clear and concise instructions make the dishes turn out exactly as they are supposed to. Persian cooking is based on vegetables, fruits, grains and meat used in subtle and varied combinations. The food is neither highly spiced nor hot but seasoned with herbs. It is very nutritious. Many of the dishes are suitable for vegetarians and in many others, meat may be easily omitted. The dishes can be made from ingredients found in almost any store. A guide to specialty stores is also included. As has often been observed, rice preparation defines the quality of the Persian chef. It is covered here in detail.</p><p>If Scheherazade had to depend on her culinary imagination to persuade the King to spare her, she doubtless would have told him about recipes such as these. There is a succulent dish, she might have begun, called Shirin Pollo, wherein rice is enfolded with strips of chicken, sweetened orange peel, pistachios and almonds. . . . On nights to follow she might whet his appetite with Fessenjoon, chicken stewed in pomegranate syrup and walnuts, or Meat and Parsley Soup with Green Plums, Roast Partridges in Cream, Lamb Hearts with Cinnamon or Cranberry and October Bean Soup. <p>After she had delved into the kookoos (souffls), the kebabs, the dolemahs, the game birds, vegetables, salads, breads and pickles, she might turn to the sweetsElephants Ears, Persian Marzipan, Sweet Fingers, the sherbets and cold sweet drinks. She would soon have the King eating out of her hand, for Persian cuisine offers something for even the most sophisticated of gourmets in search of new epicurean delights. </p><p>The oldest cuisine known to man, Persian cooking is based on lamb, fruits, vegetables and grains, used in subtle and varied combinations. The food is neither highly spiced nor hot but seasoned with herbs. It is very nutritious and very economical requiring minimum amounts of meat. Many dishes are easy to prepare ahead of time and well suited to reheating-they make good leftovers. </p><p>As Mrs. Ramazani writes: Here is a culinary art so highly developed that the most lowly vegetable can taste divine, every meal can be a gastronomic treat, every cook a creative artist.</p>Born in England, but raised in Iran, NESTA RAMAZANI is a writer and lecturer who lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.

His influence on the growth of the studio-pottery movement, both in Japan and in the West, has been profound, and his making of ceramics and his teaching of some of the foremost artist-potters of the period gives him a central place in the international history of decorative arts.</p><p>Edmund de Waal is a world-famous author and ceramicist.

Michener: A Biography</h2><p>Everyone knows the name, but scarcely anyone knows the man. James A. Michener, the world&#39;s best selling story teller, didn&#39;t begin writing until he was 40, but with Tales of the South Pacific, his first book, he hit the jackpot. Each succeeding bestseller made him a millionaire many times over. Here for the first time is Michener&#39;s life story. This biography, written with Michener&#39;s cooperation, explores the drive behind the man&#39;s success, his relationships with women, agents, editors, publishers and friends. The book was published a dozen years before Michener&#39;s death.</p><p>I met Jim Michener in the summer of 1970 when the Cleveland Plain Dealer assigned me to interview him in Kent, Ohio, where he was researching a book about the May 4 tragedy at Kent State University. I was a senior journalism major at Kent State at the time and had been an eyewitness to the horrible weekend confrontation that ended in bloodshed and the deaths of four students. After the interview Michener asked if I&#39;d like to work for him as a researcher for his book, Kent State: What Happened and Why. Of course I said Yes! For several months I had the privilege of watching Michener at work. During that time and for several years thereafter I was caught up in learning more and more about this man who had become one of the world&#39;s most cherished authors. Who was this man? What motivated him? One day I asked for his permission to write his biography. He responded haltingly - he said he didn&#39;t think anyone would really be interested in reading about him -- but gradually he cooperated with me. Fourteen years later he had cooperated considerably by introducing me to people in his life and by opening the doors to his private collections of papers at the Library of Congress and elsewhere. On numerous occasions I visited Michener at his home in Pipersville, Pa., and then St. Michaels, Md. Frequently I met up with him on the road when he was speaking or autographing books. He always found a chunk of private time to spend with me so that I could ask him more questions. Upon his suggestion, I used to send him a dozen questions by mail, and no matter where he was in the world, or what he was working on, he responded in a timely and usually enthusiastic fashion. By July 1982, however, I had either worn him down or worn out my welcome. I had sent him several pointed questions and rather than answering the questions he decided that we had &#34;reached a logical halting spot.&#34; He went on to say that his decision could not harm me because &#34;you already know more than anyone else on earth about your chosen subject matter. Were I to do tomorrow you would be totally competent to publish what you already have and to make shrewd, intelligent guesses about the rest; I feel confident your guesses would be close to the mark. . . . Well, you should proceed now as if I were gone.&#34; That said, only the writing remained. I completed the book in 1983 for publication in 1984. Meanwhile, Michener lived to the glorious age of 90 and died in 1997 at his home in Texas.John P. Hayes grew up in Dover, Ohio. While attending Kent State University he was an eyewitness of the May 4, 1970 campus tragedy, which resulted in the deaths of four students by the National Guard. Hayes was hired by James A. Michener to help research the book, Kent State: What Happened and Why. After graduating from KSU, Hayes became a journalism professor, serving the university from 1972-76. He was then recruited by Temple University in Philadelphia where he served as an assistant professor of communications while earning a doctorate in American Studies. In 1982, Hayes left the university to start a marketing company. In 1995 he sold his company and since then has been writing, speaking and consulting from his home in Dallas, Texas. He is the author or co-author of more than 15 books. Hayes has been married for 30 years and he&#39;s the father of three children.</p><h2>Future Esoteric: The Unseen Realms (The Esoteric Series)</h2><p><p>Examining the flaws of mainstream society, this collection of conspiracy theory, esoteric knowledge, and fringe subjects seeks to present solutions to current social, economic, and environmental world issues.

The first two books in this series, while written&nbsp;simultaneously, are being released in opposite order, only because "Future Esoteric" was completed first. This series is a total departure from my usual travel writing faire, but it feels very right for me to venture into these new literary waters, and also to relate information which I feel is our <i>zeitgeist</i>, or the spirit of our ages. I have&nbsp;attempted&nbsp;to chronicle the entire "alternative narrative" of all the questions and mysteries in our world. I sincerely feel this is the most important work I have released in my nearly 20 years as a professional publisher and author. I hope you will agree.&nbsp;AN ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVEThings are not as they appear. We live within a global banking, corporate, and media empire controlled by an elite few. Are their motives to provide the absolute best products and services to humankind? To be objective and truthful in their media reporting or school curriculum? Can we believe everything, or more importantly not everything, the government tells us?The term &#34;esoteric&#34; implies knowledge available to a select few. This book opens the door to the many mysteries of our world being withheld from us in the &#34;official narrative,&#34; but at what cost? What is lost when we are not fully informed in our current culture of secrecy? How will future generations view us at this pivotal moment in history?</p><h2>Revival!: A Study of Early 20th Century Colonial Revival Quilts</h2><p>Members of the American Quilt Study Group accepted the challenge to study quilts of the Colonial Revival era by making reproductions of quilts from the early 20th century.

His many books have sold millions of copies around the world and in dozens of languages. Stott's best-known work, <em>Basic Christianity,</em> has sold two million copies and has been translated into more than 60 languages. Other titles include <em>The Cross of Christ, Understanding the Bible, The Contemporary Christian, Evangelical Truth, Issues Facing Christians Today, The Incomparable Christ, Why I Am a Christian</em> and <em>Through the Bible Through the Year,</em> a daily devotional. He has also written eight volumes in <em>The Bible Speaks Today</em> series of New Testament expositions. Whether in the West or in the Two-Thirds World, a hallmark of Stott's ministry has been expository preaching that addresses the hearts and minds of contemporary men and women. Stott was honored by <em>Time</em> magazine in 2005 as one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World" and was named in the Queen&#x2019;s New Years Honours list as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1969, Stott founded the Langham Trust to fund scholarships for young evangelical leaders from the Majority World. He then founded the Evangelical Literature Trust, which provided books for students, pastors and theological libraries in the Majority World. These two trusts continued as independent charities until 2001, when they were joined as a single charity: the Langham Partnership. Langham's vision continues today to see churches in the Majority World equipped for mission and growing to maturity in Christ through nurturing national movements for biblical preaching, fostering the creation and distribution of evangelical literature, and enhancing evangelical theological education.</p><h2>Handbook of unusual natural phenomena</h2><p>Collects more than five hundred eyewitness accounts of nature&#39;s greatest mysteries, which have been documented in the most reputable and distinguished scientific journals, from cloudless rain and colored snow to multiple rainbows and rocket lightning.</p><p></p><h2>Another self;: With a wood engraving</h2><p>Another Self: With a Wood Engraving by Reynolds Stone</p><p></p><h2>Healing a Highlander&#39;s Heart (Clan Grant)</h2><p>Kidnapped at knifepoint in the middle of the night, healer Brenna Grant is spirited across the Highlands to heal a chieftain who&#x2019;s near death.

Ten mice tour a variety of thematic galleries, e.g., "Portraits," "Landscapes," "Still Lifes," and "Fantastic Creatures." On the walls are simplified renditions of famous masterpieces (mostly by male European and American artists) and short notes on the theme or genre. Printed on white borders below are engaging questions ("What are your favorite colors in these paintings? What shapes can you find-?") and commentary from the mice. Each spread also features a cat that adds a component from each exhibit into her own painting as she tours the museum. There's a lot going on, and children may have trouble staying focused. The vivid gouache pictures are busy; the reproductions are reminiscent of, but less effective than the originals. A complete list of the works and where they are located is appended.

Yogic tradition, according to Irigaray, can provide an invaluable means for restoring the vital link between the present and eternity&#x2015;and for re-envisioning the patriarchal traditions of the West. <br><br>Western, logocentric rationality tends to abstract the teachings of yoga from its everyday practice&#x2015;most importantly, from the cultivation of breath. Lacking actual, personal experience with yoga or other Eastern spiritual practices, the Western philosophers who have tried to address Hindu and Buddhist teachings&#x2015;particularly Schopenhauer&#x2015;have frequently gone astray. Not so, Luce Irigaray. Incorporating her personal experience with yoga into her provocative philosophical thinking on sexual difference, Irigaray proposes a new way of understanding individuation and community in the contemporary world. She looks toward the indigenous, pre-Aryan cultures of India&#x2015;which, she argues, have maintained an essentially creative ethic of sexual difference predicated on a respect for life, nature, and the feminine. <br><br>Irigaray's focus on breath in this book is a natural outgrowth of the attention that she has given in previous books to the elements&#x2015;air, water, and fire. By returning to fundamental human experiences&#x2015;breathing and the fact of sexual difference&#x2015;she finds a way out of the endless sociologizing abstractions of much contemporary thought to rethink questions of race, ethnicity, and globalization.</p><p><i>Between East and West</i> is an attempt to rediscover meaning for Western philosophy and culture by looking outside the Western tradition. Luce Irigaray's passionate intellect is in evidence throughout the book, which she envisions as "a quest for myself, for the world, for the other, beyond illusions, beyond lies." Irigaray, probably the foremost feminist philosopher in France, attempts to "reground" both individuality and community. To do so she examines the experiential aspects of Eastern philosophy, particularly the yogic tradition. <p> In the original elements of Indian philosophy, Irigaray finds a mythic-philosophic wellspring of ecological and sexual harmony that is predicated on a respect for difference. Ultimately, she wants to show that certain elements of pre-Aryan Indian thought allow us to reconstitute ourselves as individuals and refound our communities. And according to Irigaray, the stakes are high: "Political agendas ... need new formations, perspectives, words and logic," she writes. And if we don't find them, the 21st century "risks being nothing but a pitiful decline of the human species." <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Incorporating her personal experience with yoga into her provocative philosophical thinking on sexual difference, Irigaray proposes a new way of understanding individuation and community in the contemporary world, and an ethic of sexual difference predicated on a respect for life, nature, and the feminine.</p><h2>World of Warcraft: Bloodsworn</h2><p>As the Cataclysm rips through Azeroth, Warchief Garrosh Hellscream orders the best warriors of the Horde to come forward and serve in a new army, lest their foes in the Alliance sense weakness and attack.

This program, called the best-kept secret of the twentieth century&#x2019;s civil rights movement, was critical in preparing legions of disenfranchised people across the South to work with existing systems of local government to gain access to services and resources they were entitled to as citizens. They learned to demonstrate peacefully against injustice, even when they were met with violence and hatred. The CEP was born out of the work of the Tennessee Highlander Folk School and was fully developed and expanded by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led by Dr. King until that fateful day in Memphis in April 1968. Cotton was checked into the Lorraine Motel at that time as well, but she&#x2019;d left to do the work of the CEP before the assassin&#x2019;s bullet was fired. <br><br><i>If Your Back&#x2019;s Not Bent </i>recounts the accomplishments and the drama of this training that was largely ignored by the media, which had focused its attention on marches and demonstrations. This book describes who participated and how they were transformed&#x2014;men and women alike&#x2014;from victims to active citizens, and how they transformed their communities and ultimately the country into a place of greater freedom and justice for all. Cotton, the only woman in Dr. King&#x2019;s inner circle of leadership, for the first time offers her account of the movement, correcting the historical impression that &#x201c;we only marched and sang.&#x201d; She shows how the CEP was key to the movement&#x2019;s success, and how the lessons of the program can serve our democracy now. People, and therefore systems, can indeed change &#x201c;if your back&#x2019;s not bent.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Dorothy Cotton</b>, a lifelong activist and visionary dedicated to social justice.

How could I have come so far from that small town, one of four motherless daughters of a tobacco factory worker who made nine and sometimes twelve dollars a week? When the news came on the radio that Martin had won, I fairly danced out the front door of our Auburn Avenue office excitedly exclaiming to some of our organizers standing there, &#x201c;We won! We won! Dr. King is the winner of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize!&#x201d; I shared the news with people we knew in the shops and eateries, all the little business establishments along &#x201c;Sweet Auburn.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not sure all of them even understood the enormity of this incredible honor. But the excitement escalated. I walked around in a state of high exhilaration as well as in sort of a daze. I&#x2019;m aware still of having felt vindicated&#x2014;even more justified in the rightness of our cause. There were smiles and there were tears of joy.<br><br>Dr. King&#x2019;s entourage on the trip to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.<br> <br>My title at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was Director of Education. Though we all had rather impressive titles, most of us were fully involved in every direct action and voter education campaign. My main responsibility was directing the Citizenship Education Program (CEP). When I found out that I would be accompanying Dr. King, along with almost thirty other friends and team members, transformation truly occurred in my life. The once poor little girl from Goldsboro would be among those honored to be with Martin Luther King Jr. as he and all of us were feted in Norway&#x2019;s capital by Norwegian royalty and other European dignitaries.<br> <br>When the news came, Martin was in the hospital, where he was spending a few days for a thorough physical examination and much-needed rest from our hectic schedule. He was exhausted. Not surprisingly, he was now under even more stress as he bore the heaviest burden of our struggle to end segregation and the abuse that was inherent in such a system. It seemed the whole burgeoning civil rights movement structure was begging for his input, his guidance, and his opinion about what to do next and how to do it. Everyone wanted him in <i>their</i> town. They wanted to experience his powerful oratory, his guidance, and the confident spirit of hope he projected. And Martin wanted to respond even as the passage of the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 generated even more requests for his presence.<br> <br>President Lyndon Johnson had signed the historic bill, and Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president, had opposed it. Our choice was very clear. And there was our own organizational commitment to urge people not only to vote but to continue to work to change the unjust segregation system.<br> <br>Even though he was exhausted he wanted to respond. His ability to encourage and energize people was unmatched and he had accepted the <i>calling</i> to help &#x201c;set at liberty those who are oppressed.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the same time there were the rumbling noises of a few who, I believe out of jealousy of his leadership, were beginning to criticize his nonviolent approach and strategies, and, most important, the spirit and philosophy we held on to to tear down the walls of injustice. Our organization was committed to the struggle to &#x201c;redeem the soul of America.&#x201d;<br> <br>The exhaustion and this emerging negativity from others contributed to Dr. King&#x2019;s need to take a break, to rest and recharge. What a propitious moment for the news of his winning the Nobel Peace Prize to come to him.<br> <br>Dr. King was my best friend and I wanted to share with him this moment, of his getting the wondrous news of this prestigious prize. So I soon made my way to St. Joseph&#x2019;s Hospital and had a long visit with him. Though we interacted regularly, sitting alone by his bed in that hospital room as he reflected is one of my most memorable times with him. He took my hand for a moment. No words. He knew why I was there. I pulled up a chair. He began to reflect on his days as a college student, in a slow, almost sad sort of way. One observation he shared I&#x2019;ll never forget. He talked about seeing tall, handsome &#x201c;football player type&#x201d; guys around the campus. He said, &#x201c;I would consciously determine that I could pursue the girlfriends of such guys until I won their girlfriends away.&#x201d; He spoke as though he felt great guilt for this habit and others in the context of his feeling of unworthiness for such a prize. I wondered if he was questioning whether he deserved such an honor.<br> <br>Though this was not to be the first time I experienced him in such a pensive mood, it was probably the time when he was most self-reflective&#x2014;on his calling, his life and work. Coupled with these deep and mixed emotions was what seemed almost a sense of sadness. I was with Dr. King at an event in New York when Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel introduced him for the speech he was about to give. Somewhere in that introduction Rabbi Heschel referred to him as a saint. Afterward, as we were preparing to go to dinner, I asked him, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? You seem so dejected, sad. The response to your speech was great. What are you feeling?&#x201d; His response to me: &#x201c;Rabbi Heschel called me a saint, and I know I&#x2019;m no saint.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told him that I had shared this exchange with Andy Young and what Andy&#x2019;s reply was. I&#x2019;ve never forgotten it. Andy said, &#x201c;The saints weren&#x2019;t saints, either!&#x201d; That pretty much captured my own sense of the matter. I had read of babies found buried under nunneries. <i>The saints weren&#x2019;t saints, either!</i><br> <br>Dr. King was in a mood seldom seen by most of the staff, and even few of his friends were privy to this kind of sharing&#x2014;the intimacy of it, and the unvarnished, total honesty. His decision to share the prize with other organizations whose goals were the same as ours at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference may have eased this guilt somewhat.<br> <br>I listened to him quietly for a long time, feeling his need to reflect. If I could talk with him now I know I would remind him of something he knew at a very deep level, and that is that the God he loved uses many who are not thought of as perfect human beings. Indeed, he knew the biblical example of Paul. After all, he was a Baptist preacher.<br> <br>Of course, Dr. King not only accepted the award but rose to the occasion, delivering a magnificent, incisive speech giving generous credit to all people who were struggling for basic social change and human rights&#x2014;not only workers at SCLC, but people struggling for freedom everywhere.<br> <br>Since that December in 1964 in Oslo, I&#x2019;ve spent a good deal of time observing what we do with and to our leaders, and the impact that has on them&#x2014;how we respond to them, our expectations of them, and the burden sometimes laid on leaders by how we respond to them. Our expectations of them <i>can be</i> a burden.<br> <br>I knew that Martin&#x2019;s mood during his hospital stay would pass and that he would get back to focusing on the work that was waiting for us back in Alabama, including our continuing challenge to the segregation system we were determined to dismantle.<br> <br>Preparation for the Oslo trip would soon begin. It was an organizing project in itself, given the number of people traveling. My attention went to what I would wear at the ceremony. I located a woman with a reputation as an exquisite seamstress. Having seen her artistry, I commissioned her to make me a special outfit. Strolling through the fabric store, I chose a rich maroon velvet. I got fitted for a suit with a hat to match. It turned out indeed to be a strikingly beautiful outfit. Notwithstanding our minuscule SCLC salaries, never had I felt so committed to spend however much it would cost to make sure I looked smashingly good!<br> <br>I had visited Caribbean islands before, but never had I traveled out of the continental United States on such a long journey. Our entourage of about thirty friends, staff, and family was divided into two groups. In those days, when air crashes were more common, Martin and his wife, Coretta Scott King, had a policy of not taking long trips on the same plane. It was a safety measure. They had four small children to care for. So Martin, his mother, and about half the group, including me, were on one plane with him; the other half, including Coretta, was on a different plane.<br> <br>Something remarkable happened on our overnight flight. High above the clouds, as I was awakening, it seemed as though we were flying into the sunrise. Alberta King, Martin&#x2019;s mother, said, &#x201c;Dorothy, look out the window.&#x201d; We beheld this unearthly view&#x2014;seeing the sun coming up from such a height. Mrs. King started singing a song relevant to what we were witnessing. She sang, <i>&#x201c;Oh, day; yonder come day, day done broke in &#x2019;a my soul; yonder come day. It&#x2019;s a glorious day, yonder come day!&#x201d;</i> (I cry as I write this so many years after the experience.) &#x201c;Mama King,&#x201d; as a few people called Martin&#x2019;s mother, stood in the aisle and invited everyone to join with her in singing that song. A call-and-response song being one of the styles prevalent in African American churches, it was very easy for everyone to join in. When Mrs. King, who sometimes played the piano at Ebenezer Baptist Church, would sing <i>&#x201c;Oh, day,&#x201d;</i> the rest of our group would respond, <i>&#x201c;Yonder come day.&#x201d;</i> She would continue with &#x201c;<i>Day done broke in &#x2019;a my soul; yonder come day . . .</i>&#x201d; Someone would pick it up and soon there was a full chorus on that plane as we flew into the sunrise.<br> <br>Amazingly, I don&#x2019;t even recall if there were people on that plane other than our group. I think there were a few though I can&#x2019;t be sure.<br> <br>And yes, Dr. King would be up and energetically singing along with his mom and the rest of us. He loved to sing and always had fun doing so. He and the men on our team, Andy Young, Bernard Lafayette, Ralph Abernathy, Wyatt Tee Walker&#x2014;any who were around&#x2014;would often form a quartet, a popular form of singing among Black men in the South at the time. They all loved to sing. (So did I.)<br> <br>In any case, though we were all tired, we were all one excited and happy group. We <i>welcomed the sun</i>&#x2014;and it seemed to welcome us to a memorable experience and a new beginning in our lives.<br> <br>After landing in Oslo at Gardermoen airport and settling into our rooms, our intense program for the trip began. There were receptions, orientation meetings, and schedules to be handed out. The Nobel Committee planned some social events for us and we had the opportunity to plan a few gatherings that we ourselves wanted to have. I was asked to help handle a good bit of the organizing and logistics. This task mainly involved seeing that everyone was aware of the next thing on the schedule and where in the hotel our entourage needed to be and when.<br> <br>After one dinner gathering we were all relaxing and having a great time in the dining room set aside for us. Everyone who could sing&#x2014;and some who couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;took center stage to perform his or her &#x201c;show-off&#x201d; piece. Usually it would be a song. I&#x2019;m thinking now of what a fantastic singer Christine King Farris, Martin&#x2019;s sister, is. I don&#x2019;t remember Christine doing a solo that evening, but I wish she had! We would remember it still. Some in our group loved to recite poetry and did so that evening. Sometimes people would just emote a little, or a lot, about the event that brought us to Oslo. It was a joyous and emotional evening.<br> <br>I was getting nervous because it was time for us to vacate the dining room. As I was trying rather anxiously, though diplomatically, to stop this spontaneous talent show, someone pulled my sleeve and pointed me toward Daddy King, Martin&#x2019;s father. Daddy King was crying.<br> <br>At that moment my compulsive need to keep the group moving as scheduled seemed, and indeed was, totally unimportant.<br> <br>A sort of hush came over the group as Daddy King said, &#x201c;I want you all to join me in this moment of thanksgiving for this honor bestowed on my son. I want you to lift your glasses and with me share in a <i>toast to God.</i>&#x201d;<br> <br>I never knew Daddy King, Reverend Martin Luther King Sr., to be a drinking man, but in this moment, some Baptist teaching aside, he would engage in and indeed lead us in a toast without hesitation. In any case, I know there was no one in this very special group who was programmed against imbibing. This was certainly a spiritual, prayerful moment and could be compared to Holy Communion if one was praising God. There came a poignant moment of silence as we raised our glasses and joined Daddy King in his toast to God.<br> <br>There were now other teary eyes&#x2014;some because of the deep feelings surrounding the whole event and some because of the unique moment and expression invoked by Daddy King.<br> <br>� � � <br> <br>JUANITA ABERNATHY had a medical emergency that evening. Marian Logan went with Juanita to the hospital and stayed with her overnight there. Marian Logan was my roommate on the trip. Marian was a real singer and used to sing in supper clubs (after our journey to Oslo, Marian always called me &#x201c;roomie&#x201d;). So the two of them missed this very special happening. Juanita wasn&#x2019;t the only person who didn&#x2019;t feel well that evening. Her husband, Ralph, wasn&#x2019;t having physical pain but did express hurt feelings. Sitting in an adjacent room as Dr. King went for an interview with the press in Oslo, Ralph began to share with me the story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the action that catapulted Martin into national and international prominence. Ralph described that now historic event, when in 1955 Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a White man on the bus in Montgomery. Ralph shared with me how he had been on the scene long before Martin, how many of the people involved in the beginning of the boycott were people he had worked with for years before Martin came to Montgomery.<br> <br>As he described the leadership role he had played, tears began to roll down his face. I could feel the pain he must have felt as his good friend was getting all this glory and he was hardly mentioned, actually not mentioned, at all. And of course as Ralph was pouring out his heart to me, his wife was in the hospital for emergency medical care. This may have also contributed to his sense of loss and pain that evening. I can&#x2019;t be sure.<br> <br>The next morning, before sunrise, we were welcomed and honored by a candlelight tea service. The &#x201c;service girls&#x201d; would simply open a bedroom door and walk in with a lit candle, tea, and pastry. I was told this was a typical holiday welcome in hotels in Oslo, especially for honored guests. It was December, close enough to the holidays, and there was already an aura of Christmas in the air. It was rather surprising that they felt no need to knock. They would just walk in carrying the lit candles. I don&#x2019;t know if everyone in our group was so honored, but I was included.<br> <br>The special day arrived&#x2014;December 10, known as Human Rights Day to commemorate the approval of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the UN General Assembly in 1948. We would now spend hours dressing and otherwise getting ready for the Nobel ceremony.<br> <br>We arrived at Oslo City Hall. There was a feeling of reverence and awe as we entered. As we took our seats, I was overtaken&#x2014;moved to tears as the orchestra welcomed us by playing tunes from <i>Porgy and Bess.</i> But I also remember feeling confused by their selection of this popular opera. I knew the reason: ...</p><h2>Farewell to the king;</h2><p>A mysterious white man who claims to be the king of the head-hunting Muruts of Borneo agrees to help Allies fight the Japanese</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Woman with a Gun: A Novel</h2><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling master of mystery Phillip Margolin transcends his traditional territory in this new and different book, a haunting thriller inspired by an unforgettable photograph.</p><p>Visiting an art museum displaying a retrospective of acclaimed photographer Kathy Moran's work, aspiring novelist Stacey Kim is stunned by the photo at the center of the show&#x2014;the famous "Woman with a Gun," which won a Pulitzer Prize and launched the photographer's career.

Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s The Beautiful and the Damned includes an introduction by Geoff Dyer in Penguin Modern Classics. Anthony Patch and his wife Gloria are the essence of Jazz Age glamour. A brilliant and magnetic couple, they fling themselves at life with an energy that is thrilling. New York is a playground where they dance and drink for days on end. Their marriage is a passionate theatrical performance; they are young, rich, alive and lovely and they intend to inherit the earth. But as money becomes tight, their marriage becomes impossible. And with their inheritance still distant, Anthony and Gloria must face reality; they may be beautiful - but they are also damned. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) has acquired a mythical status in American literary history, and his masterwork The Great Gatsby is considered by many to be the &#39;great American novel&#39;. In 1920 he married Zelda Sayre, dubbed &#39;the first American Flapper&#39;, and their traumatic marriage and Zelda&#39;s gradual descent into insanity became the leading influence on his writing. As well as many short stories, Fitzgerald wrote five novels This Side of Paradise, The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and the Damned, Tender is the Night and, incomplete at the time of his death, The Last Tycoon. After his death The New York Times said of him that &#39;in fact and in the literary sense he created a &#34;generation&#34; &#39;. If you enjoyed The Beautiful and the Damned, you might like John Dos Passos&#39; Manhattan Transfer, also available in Penguin Classics. &#39;A prose that has the tough delicacy of a garnet&#39; New York Review of Books</p><p>This edition includes a detailed account of the composition of the novel, a textual apparatus, a chronology of composition, and, uniquely, three versions of the ending. Explanatory notes situate The Beautiful and Damned in its times and deepen the reader&#39;s understanding of Fitzgerald&#39;s sources for the novel.Following the great critical and financial success of his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise,</i> F. Scott Fitzgerald published <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> in 1922. An immediate success upon its first publication, Fitzgerald's second novel is a dazzling portrait of love and life among the beautiful people. Through the story of two newlyweds, Anthony Patch of New York and Gloria Gilbert of Kansas City, Fitzgerald flawlessly captures the heady atmosphere and jaded values of the Jazz Age. Patch, expecting to become the sole heir to his grandfather's millions, embraces a life of endless parties and intellectual pretensions. In Gloria, he finds an exquisite ornament and a passionate lover. The couple whirls through days that mirror Fitzgerald's own--a fast life amid a smart set for which there is never enough cash. Beginning with wit and clever repartee, <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> quickly becomes a scathing chronicle of a dying marriage and a hedonistic society where beauty is all too fleeting. Through the character of Richard Caramel, a successful hack writer whose talent fails as he prospers, Fitzgerald caricatures himself. But today's readers will find an even more poignant self-portrait of Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda in Anthony and Gloria, a couple whose days of wine and roses fade quickly toward a tragic end.</p><h2>Carrion comfort: A new novel</h2><p><p><b>The Past...</b><br>Caught behind the lines of Hitler&#x2019;s Final Solution, Saul Laski is one of the multitudes destined to die in the notorious Chelmno extermination camp.

I thought that was in very bad taste. She had her scrapbook laid out on my mahogany coffee table, newspaper clippings neatly arranged in chronological order, the bald statements of death recording all of her Feedings. Nina Drayton&#x2019;s smile was as radiant as ever, but her pale blue eyes showed no hint of warmth.</p> <p>&#x201c;We should wait for Willi,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course, Melanie. You&#x2019;re right, as always. How silly of me. I know the rules.&#x201d; Nina stood and began walking around the room, idly touching the furnishings or exclaiming softly over a ceramic statuette or piece of needlepoint. This part of the house had once been the conservatory, but now I used it as my sewing room. Green plants still caught the morning light. The sunlight made it a warm, cozy place in the daytime, but now that winter had come the room was too chilly to use at night. Nor did I like the sense of darkness closing in against all those panes of glass.</p> <p>&#x201c;I love this house,&#x201d; said Nina. She turned and smiled at me. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much I look forward to coming back to Charleston. We should hold all of our reunions here.&#x201d;</p> <p>I knew how much Nina loathed this city, this house.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi would be hurt,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know how he likes to show off his place in Beverly Hills. And his new girlfriends.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And boyfriends,&#x201d; said Nina and laughed. Of all the changes and darkenings in Nina, her laugh has been least affected. It was still the husky but childish laugh that I had first heard so long ago. It had drawn me to her then&#x2014;one lonely, adolescent girl responding to the warmth of another like a moth to a flame. Now it only served to chill me and put me even more on my guard. Enough moths had been drawn to Nina&#x2019;s flame over the many decades.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send for tea,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>Mr. Thorne brought the tea in my best Wedgwood china. Nina and I sat in the slowly moving squares of sunlight and spoke softly of nothing important; mutually ignorant comments on the economy, references to books which the other had not got around to reading, and sympathetic murmurs about the low class of persons one meets while flying these days. Someone peering in from the garden might have thought they were seeing an aging but attractive niece visiting her favorite aunt. (I draw the line at suggesting that anyone would mistake us for mother and daughter.) People usually consider me a well-dressed if not stylish person. Heaven knows I have paid enough to have the wool skirts and silk blouses mailed from Scotland and France. But next to Nina I always felt dowdy. This day she wore an elegant, light blue dress which must have cost several thousand dollars if I had identified the designer correctly. The color made her complexion seem even more perfect than usual and brought out the blue of her eyes. Her hair had gone as gray as mine, but somehow she managed to get away with wearing it long and tied back with a single barrette. It looked youthful and chic on Nina and made me feel that my short, artificial curls were glowing with a blue rinse.</p> <p>Few would suspect that I was four years younger than Nina. Time had been kind to her. And she had Fed more often.</p> <p>She set down her cup and saucer and moved aimlessly around the room again. It was not like Nina to show such signs of nervousness. She stopped in front of the glass display case. Her gaze passed over the Hummels, the pewter pieces, and then stopped in surprise.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good heavens, Melanie. A pistol! What an odd place to put an old pistol.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an heirloom,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Quite expensive. And you&#x2019;re right, it is a silly place to keep it. But it&#x2019;s the only case I have in the house with a lock on it and Mrs. Hodges often brings her grandchildren when she visits&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You mean it&#x2019;s loaded?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, of course not,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;But children should not play with such things&#x2026;&#x201d; I trailed off lamely. Nina nodded but did not bother to conceal the condescension in her smile. She went to look out the south window into the garden.</p> <p>Damn her. It said volumes about Nina Drayton that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>On the day he was killed, Charles Edgar Larchmont had been my beau for precisely five months and two days. There had been no formal announcement, but we were to be married. Those five months had been a microcosm of the era itself&#x2014;naive, flirtatious, formal to the point of preciosity, and romantic. Most of all romantic. Romantic in the worst sense of the word; dedicated to saccharine or insipid ideals that only an adolescent&#x2014;or an adolescent society&#x2014;would strive to maintain. We were children playing with loaded weapons.</p> <p>Nina, she was Nina Hawkins then, had her own beau&#x2014;a tall, awkward, but well-meaning Englishman named Roger Harrison. Mr. Harrison had met Nina in London a year earlier during the first stages of the Hawkins&#x2019;s Grand Tour. Declaring himself smitten&#x2014;another absurdity of those childish times&#x2014;the tall Englishman had followed her from one European capital to another until, after being firmly reprimanded by Nina&#x2019;s father (an unimaginative little milliner who was constantly on the defensive about his doubtful social status), Harrison returned to London to &#x201c;settle his affairs&#x201d; only to show up some months later in New York just as Nina was being packed off to her aunt&#x2019;s home in Charleston in order to terminate yet another flirtation. Still undaunted, the clumsy Englishman followed her south, ever mindful of the protocols and restrictions of the day.</p> <p>We were a gay group. The day after I met Nina at Cousin Celia&#x2019;s June Ball, the four of us were taking a hired boat up the Cooper River for a picnic on Daniel Island. Roger Harrison, serious and solemn on every topic, was a perfect foil for Charles&#x2019;s irreverent sense of humor. Nor did Roger seem to mind the good-natured jesting since he was soon joining in the laughter with his peculiar haw-haw-haw.</p> <p>Nina loved it all. Both gentlemen showered attention on her and while Charles never failed to show the primacy of his affection for me, it was understood by all that Nina Hawkins was one of those young women who invariably becomes the center of male gallantry and attention in any gathering. Nor were the social strata of Charleston blind to the combined charm of our foursome. For two months of that now distant summer, no party was complete, no excursion adequately planned, and no occasion considered a success unless we four merry pranksters were invited and had chosen to attend. Our happy dominance of the youthful social scene was so pronounced that Cousins Celia and Loraine wheedled their parents into leaving two weeks early for their annual August sojourns in Maine.</p> <p>I am not sure when Nina and I came up with the idea of the duel. Perhaps it was during one of the long, hot nights when the other &#x201c;slept over&#x201d;&#x2014;creeping into the other&#x2019;s bed, whispering and giggling, stifling our laughter when the rustling of starched uniforms betrayed the presence of our colored maids moving through the darkened halls. In any case, the idea was the natural outgrowth of the romantic pretensions of the time. The picture of Charles and Roger actually dueling over some abstract point of honor related to us thrilled both of us in a physical way which I recognize now as a simple form of sexual titillation.</p> <p>It would have been harmless except for our Ability. We had been so successful in our manipulation of male behavior&#x2014;a manipulation which was both expected and encouraged in those days&#x2014;that neither of us had yet suspected that there lay anything beyond the ordinary in the way we could translate our whims into other people&#x2019;s actions. The field of parapsychology did not exist then: or rather, it existed only in the rappings and knockings of parlor game s�ances. At any rate, we amused ourselves with whispered fantasies for several weeks and then one of us&#x2014;or perhaps both of us&#x2014;used the Ability to translate the fantasy into reality.</p> <p>In a sense it was our first Feeding.</p> <p>I do not remember the purported cause of the quarrel, perhaps some deliberate misinterpretation of one of Charles&#x2019;s jokes. I can not recall who Charles and Roger arranged to have serve as seconds on that illegal outing. I do remember the hurt and confused expression on Roger Harrison&#x2019;s face during those few days. It was a caricature of ponderous dullness, the confusion of a man who finds himself in a situation not of his making and from which he cannot escape. I remember Charles and his mercurial swings of mood&#x2014;the bouts of humor, periods of black anger, and the tears and kisses the night before the duel.</p> <p>I remember with great clarity the beauty of that morning. Mists were floating up from the river and diffusing the rays of the rising sun as we rode out to the dueling field. I remember Nina reaching over and squeezing my hand with an impetuous excitement that was communicated through my body like an electric shock.</p> <p>Much of the rest of that morning is missing. Perhaps in the intensity of that first, subconscious Feeding I literally lost consciousness as I was engulfed in the waves of fear, excitement, pride&#x2026;of maleness&#x2026;that was emanating from our two beaus as they faced death on that lovely morning. I remember experiencing the shock of realizing this is really happening as I shared the tread of high boots through the grass. Someone was calling off the paces. I dimly recall the weight of the pistol in my hand&#x2026;Charles&#x2019;s hand I think, I will never know for sure&#x2026;and a second of cold clarity before an explosion broke the connection and the acrid smell of gunpowder brought me back to myself.</p> <p>It was Charles who died. I have never been able to forget the incredible quantities of blood which poured from the small, round hole in his breast. His white shirt was crimson by the time I reached him. There had been no blood in our fantasies. Nor had there been the sight of Charles with his head lolling, mouth dribbling saliva onto his bloodied chest while his eyes rolled back to show the whites like two eggs embedded in his skull. Roger Harrison was sobbing as Charles breathed his final, shuddering gasps on that field of innocence.</p> <p>I remember nothing at all about the confused hours which followed. It was the next morning that I opened my cloth bag to find Charles&#x2019;s pistol lying with my things. Why would I have kept that revolver? If I had wished to take something from my fallen lover as a sign of remembrance, why that alien piece of metal? Why pry from his dead fingers the symbol of our thoughtless sin?</p> <p>It said volumes about Nina that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was not Mr. Thorne announcing the arrival of our guest but Nina&#x2019;s &#x201c;amanuensis,&#x201d; the loathsome Miss Barrett Kramer. Kramer&#x2019;s appearance was as unisex as her name; short cropped, black hair, powerful shoulders, and a blank, aggressive gaze which I associated with lesbians and criminals. She looked to be in her mid-thirties.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you, Barrett, dear,&#x201d; said Nina.</p> <p>I went to greet Willi, but Mr. Thorne had already let him in and we met in the hallway.</p> <p>&#x201c;Melanie! You look marvelous! You grow younger each time I see you. Nina!&#x201d; The change in Willi&#x2019;s voice was evident. Men continued to be overpowered by their first sight of Nina after an absence. There were hugs and kisses. Willi himself looked more dissolute than ever. His alpaca sports coat was exquisitely tailored, his turtleneck sweater successfully concealed the eroded lines of his wattled neck, but when he swept off his jaunty sportscar cap the long strands of white hair he had brushed forward to hide his encroaching baldness were knocked into disarray. Willi&#x2019;s face was flushed with excitement, but there was also the telltale capillary redness about the nose and cheeks which spoke of too much liquor, too many drugs.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ladies, I think you&#x2019;ve met my associates&#x2026;Tom Reynolds and Jensen Luhar?&#x201d; The two men added to the crowd in my narrow hall. Mr. Reynolds was thin and blond, smiling with perfectly capped teeth. Mr. Luhar was a gigantic Negro, hulking forward with a sullen, bruised look on his coarse face. I was sure that neither Nina nor I had encountered these specific catspaws of Willi&#x2019;s before.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we go into the parlor?&#x201d; I suggested. It was an awkward procession ending with the three of us seated on the heavily upholstered chairs surrounding the Georgian tea table which had been my grandmother&#x2019;s. &#x201c;More tea, please, Mr. Thorne.&#x201d; Miss Kramer took that as her cue to leave, but Willi&#x2019;s two pawns stood uncertainly by the door, shifting from foot to foot and glancing at the crystal on display as if their mere proximity could break something. I would not have been surprised if that had proven to be the case.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jensen!&#x201d; Willi snapped his fingers. The Negro hesitated and then brought forward an expensive leather attach� case. Willi set it on the tea table and clicked the catches open with his short, broad fingers. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you two see Miz Fuller&#x2019;s man about getting something to drink?&#x201d;</p> <p>When they were gone Willi shook his head and smiled at Nina. &#x201c;Sorry about that, love.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nina put her hand on Willi&#x2019;s sleeve. She leaned forward with an air of expectancy. &#x201c;Melanie wouldn&#x2019;t let me begin the Game without you. Wasn&#x2019;t that awful of me to want to start without you, Willi dear?&#x201d;</p> <p>Willi frowned. After fifty years he still bridled at being called Willi. In Los Angeles he was Big Bill Borden. When he returned to his native Germany&#x2014;which was not often because of the dangers involved&#x2014;he was once again Wilhelm von Borchert, lord of dark manor, forest, and hunt. But Nina had called him Willi when they had first met in 1925, in Vienna, and Willi he had remained.</p> <p>&#x201c;You begin, Willi,&#x201d; said Nina. &#x201c;You go first.&#x201d;</p> <p>I could remember the time when we would have spent the first few days of our reunion in conversation and catching up with each other&#x2019;s lives. Now there was not even time for small talk.</p> <p>Willi showed his teeth and removed news clippings, notebooks, and a stack of cassettes from his briefcase. No sooner had he covered the small table with his material than Mr. Thorne arrived with the tea and Nina&#x2019;s scrapbook from the sewing room. Willi brusquely cleared a small space.</p> <p>At first glance one might see certain similarities between Willi Borchert and Mr. Thorne. One would be mistaken. Both men tend to the florid, but Willi&#x2019;s complexion was the result of excess and emotion: Mr. Thorne had known neither of these for many years. Willi&#x2019;s balding was a patchy, self-consciously concealed thing&#x2014;a weasel with the mange&#x2014;while Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s bare head was smooth and unwrinkled. One could not imagine Mr. Thorne ever having had hair. Both men had gray eyes&#x2014;what a novelist would call cold, gray eyes&#x2014;but Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s eyes were cold with indifference, cold with a clarity coming from an absolute absence of troublesome emotion or thought. Willi&#x2019;s eyes were the cold of a blustery North Sea winter and were often clouded with shifting curtains of the emotions that controlled him&#x2014;pride, hatred, love of pain, the pleasures of destruction. Willi never referred to his use of the Ability as Feedings&#x2014;I was evidently the only one who thought in those terms&#x2014;but Willi sometimes talked of the Hunt. Perhaps it was the dark forests of his homeland that he thought of as he stalked his human quarry through the sterile streets of Los Angeles. Did Willi dream of the forest? I wondered. Did he look back to green wool hunting jackets, the applause of retainers, the gouts of blood from the dying boar? Or did Willi remember the slam of jackboots on cobblestones and the pounding of his lieutenants&#x2019; fists on doors? Perhaps Willi still associated his Hunt with the dark European ...</p></p><h2>Hell Above Earth: The Incredible True Story of an American WWII Bomber Commander and the Copilot Ordered to Kill Him</h2><p>Hell Above Earth tells an unforgettable story of two World War II American bomber pilots who forged an unexpected but enduring bond in the flak-filled skies over Nazi Germany. But there's a twist: one of them was related to the head of the Luftwaffe, Reich Marshal Herman Goering, and the other had secret orders from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, to kill him if anything went wrong during their missions.A heart-wrenching Greatest Generation buddy story, an adrenaline-filled account of aerial combat, and a work of popular history, Hell Above Earthcenters around the author's discovery of a half-century old secret that has far-reaching and deeply personal repercussions for the pilots, and profound consequences for&nbsp;the FBI and the "Mighty" Eighth Air Force.</p><p>HELL ABOVE EARTH<br><br>"Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!&nbsp; And thou sayest, How doth God know? Can he judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering to him that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven." Job 22:12<br>&nbsp;<br>"For a long time we hated the idea of the heavy bomber...We now know that the champion, that the backbone of air power is the heavy bomber." - John Steinbeck, 1942<br>&nbsp;<br>Preface<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While writing a non-fiction book review about the Battle of Britain, I stumbled across newspaper articles, books, and military web sites which categorically stated that Nazi Luftwaffe head Herman W. Goering, Adolf Hitler's legal successor, had American relatives including a nephew, Werner G. Goering, who was a WWII&nbsp; bomber pilot in the European Theater.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Army records confirmed that Werner, a twenty-one year old "Mighty Eighth" Army Air Force captain in early 1945, commanded forty-nine "Flying Fortress" combat missions over Nazi-occupied Europe, well beyond the 30 sorties which then constituted a squadron lead-pilot's tour of duty. He could have gone home by Christmas of 1944 as most of his original crewmates did, but at the peak of the bloody air war, Werner signed on for a second tour with the British based 303rd Bombardment Group, famed as The Hell's Angels, one of America's most storied warrior fraternities and the single most active bomber group in the Army Air Force. He fought until the bitter end - the Nazi surrender on May 8, 1945. Among a fistful of other medals, he received the Distinguished Flying Cross, one of the nations's highest military decorations.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary Moncur, the 303rd Bombardment Group's historian and son of Captain Vern Moncur, a WWII Hell's Angels pilot, features Werner's story on the unit's web site where a page is devoted to the irony of the Goering Crew fighting against the Luftwaffe led by Werner's infamous Uncle Herman. When I contacted him for information about Werner, Gary's reply was "Good luck, I've never met, corresponded, nor spoken with him." Werner would have been 85 and Gary thought he was still alive.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the sixty-five years following the Nazi capitulation, Werner attended only one annual reunion of The Hell's Angels, in 1992 in Boise, Idaho - the hometown of his co-pilot Lt. Jack Rencher. Goering's appearance was a singular tribute to his lifelong friend. He is the unit's reclusive, legendary specter and prodigal son who served his country well beyond a full measure and then seemed to vanish.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took months to reach Werner for a brief phone call. Taciturn and wary- - he hated reporters - and didn't want to talk about the war or his family with a stranger yet consented to meet if I was willing to come to Tucson.&nbsp; But, he warned "It will be a waste of your time and money, since I didn't do anything special and left the war behind a long time ago." <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days later, while flying to meet the reclusive Goering who avoided the spotlight for nearly seven decades, it hit me that it was the chronological equivalent of meeting a Civil War veteran in 1930. He is among the very last of his peers - a man who saw and did things the world had never previously experienced, and never will again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He quietly carried the burden of his blood-soaked surname throughout the war and beyond; battled the Nazi war machine in the war's longest and deadliest battle for Americans, and was nearly assassinated by a suspicious U.S. government as the Luftwaffe was killing his comrades by the tens of thousands.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an aloof, quiet, loner and non-drinker didn't help. He avoided the officer's club, the center of WWII military social life, which just heightened the mystery surrounding the "damn reservist" American pilot with the infamous surname. "What the hell was Werner Goering doing piloting an American heavy bomber over Germany?" It was a question military and civilian intelligence had struggled with and prepared for, with extreme prejudice, if and when the need arose.<br>&nbsp;<br>Stephen Frater<br>Narragansett, Rhode Island<br>June 24, 2011Stephen Frater, Writer in Residence at the University of Rhode Island, is a graduate of Brown University.

Thompson</p><p></p><h2>Love &amp; War: Twenty Years, Three Presidents, Two Daughters and One Louisiana Home</h2><p>For twenty years, James Carville and Mary Matalin have held the mantle of the nation&#x2019;s most politically opposed, ideologically mismatched, and intensely opinionated couple. In this follow-up to their groundbreaking <i>All&#x2019;s Fair: Love, War, and Running for President</i>, Carville and Matalin take a look at how they&#x2014;and America&#x2014;have changed in the last two decades. If nothing else, this new collaboration proves that after twenty years of marriage they can still manage to agree on a few things.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Love &amp; War </i>traces, in their two distinct voices, James and Mary&#x2019;s story from the end of the 1992 presidential campaign&#x2014;where he managed Bill Clinton&#x2019;s electoral triumph while she suffered defeat as George H. W. Bush&#x2019;s key strategist&#x2014;till now. Mary focuses on issues of family, faith, and foreign enemies and offers insights from her kitchen table as well as the White House Cabinet Room, while James&#x2019;s concentration is politics and love&#x2014;the triumphant and troubled Clinton era, George W. Bush&#x2019;s complicated presidency, the election of Barack Obama, the rise of the corrosive partisanship that dominates political life in Washington today, and the overriding abiding romance he holds for his native Louisiana and his wife and children. Together, the Carville-Matalins reflect on raising two daughters in the pressure cooker of the nation&#x2019;s capital, and their momentous 2008 decision to leave D.C. and move their family to New Orleans. Post-Katrina, James and Mary&#x2019;s efforts to rebuild and promote that city have become a central part of their lives&#x2014;and a poignant metaphor for moving the nation forward.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fascinating look at the last two decades in American politics and an intimate, quick-witted primer on grown-up relationships and values, <i>Love &amp; War </i>provides unprecedented insight into one of our nation&#x2019;s most intriguing and powerful couples.

Dusk was just ending and the air was thick, like a cocktail of air and water. I ventured outside to walk the dogs. The street was dark, weirdly quiet. I looked back at the empty house we&#x2019;d just moved into, a rambling mansion by my standards, but certainly not by the standards of New Orleans, a world unto itself, a distinctly American city with a romantic European grandeur.</p><p>I wondered what the new house, and a new city, would bring us. After twenty years of holy and unholy matrimony&#x2014;including storms, hurricanes, wars, disruptive house moves that James always hated, raising two daughters into teenagehood and our own separate moments on the frontlines of political battles, presidential elections, punditry pontification and, yes, if I can go braggadocio on you, even history&#x2014;we had worked out a way of living together, staying together and being happier.</p><p>There had been too many trials. Even more errors. One thing we learned: if peace could visit us, even illusively, it required well-thought-out living arrangements.</p><p>James and I needed space. Mostly from each other.</p><p>To be happy under the same roof, we required our own offices, our own bathrooms and our own closets. We needed a well-functioning kitchen with a double sink, a big icebox and enough room so our family, all of us&#x2014;true foodies and amateur cooks&#x2014;could concoct our meals. We needed a dining room for big gatherings, a lair for mass viewings of TV football games, and a hangout place where our daughters, Matty and Emerson, could be with their friends, inclusive of but not restricted to pajama parties.</p><p>I had my own personal requirements: windows that open for fresh air, a garden where all my animals could run. I needed bookshelves, lots and lots of shelves for my old books, loved and cared for and purchased over a lifetime, way before I had girls who grew up to be book junkies and collectors themselves. Once it had seemed like a huge luxury, but I was now dependent on a soaking tub for temporary escapes from reality. A fireplace wasn&#x2019;t mandatory but greatly appreciated.</p><p>James had his own list of must-haves. He gave me explicit instructions: if we were going to move to New Orleans, we couldn&#x2019;t live in the French Quarter (tough for kids), we could not be on St. Charles (too much traffic), and we had to be near his work (he was going to try teaching at Tulane) and a place for his daily jog.</p><p>But there was more: the house had to have super air-conditioning (Southerners are psycho about their fake chilled air), a killer shower with strong water pressure (no longer available in the era of environmental wackos and efficient toilet flushing). And most of all, he needed a private space where he could close the doors and never have to interact with any of my animals. And a special &#x201c;steam&#x201d; component in the shower was not mandatory but greatly appreciated.</p><p>Nobody got 100 percent of the must-haves on their list. These were the grounds for opening negotiations.</p><p>On a family visit to New Orleans, I had gone house hunting alone. This gave me a distinct advantage. But there was no other way. James hates shopping for real estate almost as much as he hates snow. He opted instead for daytime drinking and lamenting with his sisters over his wife&#x2019;s out-of-control materialism. I didn&#x2019;t expect to find the right house immediately&#x2014;who ever does? But after viewing five or six houses that were in the realm of possibility, and thanks to the astoundingly astute Realtor queen, Carmen Duncan, I discovered the grand vintage New Orleans home of my dreams.</p><p>I was sure.</p><p>I was in love.</p><p>My father had just died and I had a feeling that the house was his parting supernatural gift to me. It happened so suddenly, so easily: it was meant to be. I&#x2019;ll admit, it was a tad pricey given James&#x2019;s parameters, but the house called to me. And the neighborhood called to me, and all around it, the shattered city, a place I loved.</p><p>I telephoned James, breathless with excitement and flushed with victory. &#x201c;You have to come immediately and see this house!&#x201d; He complied, and soon afterward he pulled up with his sisters in tow&#x2014;so many Carvilles squeezed together in one vehicle that they could barely exit in a civilized manner.</p><p>JAMES</p><p>After Hurricane Katrina, I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about the fragility of New Orleans. What really sets it apart from almost anywhere else in America is this: its survival isn&#x2019;t guaranteed. Washington is going to be there fifty years from now. Dallas is going to be there. Nashville might get a flood or a tornado, but it&#x2019;ll be there. Atlanta, Houston, Chicago, they&#x2019;re not going anywhere.</p><p>In New Orleans, that&#x2019;s never a given. The city&#x2019;s permanent existence is never assured. It&#x2019;s environmentally fragile, it&#x2019;s economically fragile, and it&#x2019;s politically fragile. After Katrina, it really could have gone either way.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t believe the stories I was hearing back in D.C. I understood what it meant that the levees had broken and that the water was going to go to the level of the lake. But it wasn&#x2019;t only that two-thirds of the city had flooded. It was that the whole culture could go under. So many musical instruments had washed away, and the musicians who owned them were scattered all across the country. Hundreds of doctors left. Schools closed.</p><p>I started having visions that New Orleans would wind up as a little spit of land on the Mississippi, the size of Key West. I could imagine us sitting around a piano thirty years from now, playing a couple of old songs and telling the kids how it used to be.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been raised sixty miles up the river in Carville, a little town named after my grandfather, who was the postmaster. I&#x2019;d already witnessed pieces of old Louisiana disappear. My mother was Cajun, descended from the Acadians who settled in Louisiana, and she and my grandmother would talk to each other in French. I remember being kind of embarrassed by that as a kid. I wasn&#x2019;t the only one. After World War II, everybody just wanted to be an American.</p><p>These days, there are relatively few French speakers in Louisiana, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case when I was growing up. I worked offshore on a dredge boat, and I&#x2019;d hear people say, &#x201c;You know what, I just can&#x2019;t explain it to you in English.&#x201d; There were some French- language radio stations, but they&#x2019;ve largely gone off the air. As I got older, I couldn&#x2019;t believe that we were so stupid, as a people, to lose that part of our culture.</p><p>Culture is everything in New Orleans. If you live in Washington, you have three airports nearby. You&#x2019;ve got stunning parks, breathtaking public spaces. The museums are world-class, not to mention free. You&#x2019;ve got a world-class subway system. There&#x2019;s a real quality of life.</p><p>But nobody does culture like New Orleans. Most people know exactly what a Mardi Gras carnival krewe looks like. You&#x2019;ve probably got a pretty good idea what a New Orleans funeral looks like. Our food, our music, our architecture, our second-line parades&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all very distinctive. Think about it. Who ever went to an Ohio restaurant and listened to Oregon music?</p><p>After the storm, the thought kept gnawing at me: what if that culture doesn&#x2019;t last? I had come to New Orleans and used it and abused it as a young man. I&#x2019;d go down to the French Quarter to get drunk and stupid. Years later, Mary and I got married there. I always had a deep affection for the place. But I&#x2019;d never done that much to really support it. For so long, I had taken for granted that it would always be here, all of that emotion and passion and creativity.</p><p>When it dawned on me that it might not, I went from simply missing New Orleans to feeling this gripping fear that it might fade away before I could get down there for good. As much as anything, I wanted to get back home before home disappeared.</p></p><h2>Sound and Sentiment: Birds, Weeping, Poetics, and Song in Kaluli Expression (Conduct and Communication)</h2><p><p>Winner of the 1991 J.

David Abulafia&#39;s The Great Sea is the first complete history of the Mediterranean, from the erection of temples on Malta around 3500 BC to modern tourism. Ranging across time and the whole extraordinary space of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Jaffa, Genoa to Tunis, and bringing to life pilgrims, pirates, sultans and naval commanders, this is the story of the sea that has shaped much of world history.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> In this expansive yet detailed historical gem, David Abulafia covers the full course of human history on the Mediterranean. Beginning more than 20,000 years ago with Cro-Magnon cave dwellers on Gibraltar and stretching to the present, Abulafia treats the Great Sea as &#x201c;the Liquid Continent,&#x201d; a place peopled and traveled&#x2014;where trade, cultural exchange, and empire-building were forces as key to life as currents, tides, and weather patterns. The book deftly illustrates how the Mediterranean was always big enough to keep cultures apart, thus allowing them the space to flourish as unique entities, but that it was never so big that differing cultures couldn&#x2019;t interact. The result is an epic story of trade and conflict, showing how differences in language, religion, law, and other human flashpoints sparked so much of what we think of today simply as <em>culture</em>. --<em>Chris Schluep</em> <p></p> <strong><br>Amazon Exclusive: Author Q&amp;A with David Abulafia</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author David Abulafia</td> </tr> <tr> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What role did Greek mythology and Homeric poetry play in creating a lasting conception of the Mediterranean?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The seas described in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> are a strange amalgam of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, of east and west. Circe the sorceress seems to live in the east, where the sun rises, while Scylla and Charybdis are often identified with the straits between Sicily and mainland Italy.</p> <p>Despite those muddles, Homer does provide fascinating testimony to knowledge of the seas among the Greek colonists in Ionia (what is now eastern Turkey), whose dialect was the basis of Homeric Greek. He knew about Phoenician sailors and was not very complimentary about them. Above all, he placed Odysseus' kingdom at the western limits of Greece, on Ithaka, which he portrayed as an island where it was natural to know how to handle boats. What we see is a dawning conception of the extent of the Mediterranean and of the importance of the sea to the early Greeks.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Beyond the historical, military significance of the Mediterranean, what happened culturally that we tend to overlook?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The Mediterranean has been a meeting place of many different ethnic and religious groups, inhabiting its shores and islands--in remote antiquity, Greeks, Etruscans, Phoenicians; in later centuries, Jews, Christians and Muslims. Gathering in the port cities around the Mediterranean, such as ancient Marseilles, medieval Palermo and Alexandria, modern Livorno and Smyrna, these groups have interacted not just at the level of high culture but in everyday life. On the one hand you have the transmission of medical and astronomical knowledge from east to west in the Middle Ages, often via Muslim and Christian Spain, and on the other hand you have the peaceful interaction of traders and sailors doing business and respecting one another in the great ports of the Mediterranean. Often they were able to cross the boundaries between warring competitors for control of the sea, moving between Christian and Muslim lands under the protection of local rulers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Americans and Europeans have vastly different conceptions of the Mediterranean Sea, with most Americans thinking of the Sea and its shores primarily for its appeal as a tourist destination. What role, if any, has the Mediterranean had in shaping the United States?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The American involvement in the Mediterranean at the start of the nineteenth century is a fascinating story--not just an episode but something that decisively altered the Mediterranean world. By defeating the rulers of the Barbary regencies (Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli), who detained their trading ships and sailors and demanded extortionate sums of money for their release, the American navy helped clear the Mediterranean of the five-century-long scourge of piracy. This was the first foreign war of the United States after independence, and it was now that the U.S. Navy came into existence. In the 20th century, the strategic significance of the Mediterranean in the Cold War brought the U.S.A.F. to Wheelus airfield in Libya and the conflict between Israel and its neighbors has also brought the U.S. Navy into the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean has remained important to the U.S., as we see from the latest events in Libya.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the Mediterranean continue to play a key role in the global economy of the 21st century?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Much depends on the relationship between northern and southern Europe, and between Europe and North Africa. With the Greek economy in desperate straits and the Italian and Spanish economies under severe strain, and with the Arab countries in turmoil, there is a big question mark over the assumption that rapid economic growth will continue in the region. One solution may be to build closer bonds between northern and southern Mediterranean countries, including free trade concessions to Tunisia and Libya. Tunisia possessed the strongest economy in Africa and it would be a disaster to ignore its great economic potential. Another question arises over Chinese investment and involvement in the Mediterranean, which has begun to accumulate. So we are looking at a particularly uncertain future.</p>David Abulafia is Professor of Mediterranean History at the University of Cambridge, and a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, and was until recently Chairman of the Cambridge History Faculty.

I had just wrapped shooting on the pilot of a new TV series, <i>The Beast.</i> My wife, Lisa, and I were enjoying a second honeymoon of sorts after a long, difficult period in which we had grown painfully apart. And I was feeling excited about new work, new directions, and the promise of the future.</p><p>Lisa and I were planning to spend New Year's Eve at our ranch in New Mexico, as we'd done for the past few years. But first, we stopped off in Aspen to visit a couple of friends. It was there that I got the first hint that something was wrong.</p><p>I had been having some digestive trouble, mostly acid reflux and a kind of bloated feeling, for a few weeks. I've had a sensitive stomach my whole life, so I hadn't thought much of it, but lately I just couldn't shake the constant discomfort. I wasn't hungry and felt sick whenever I did eat, but I'd always been pretty healthy, so I figured the feeling would pass eventually.</p><p>In Aspen, we all raised glasses of champagne for a toast. I took a sip, and as the champagne began to course through my esophagus to my stomach, I nearly choked -- it burned like acid going down. It felt like I'd drunk lye, a sharp, searing pain that brought tears to my eyes. I'd never felt anything like it, but not wanting to ruin the festivities, I said nothing to Lisa. I was used to ignoring pain, so I just didn't drink any more champagne that night, and didn't think anything more about it.</p><p>Three weeks later, in January 2008, I learned that the burning in my stomach wasn't some minor irritation. It was the result of blockage in my bile ducts, which was caused by pancreatic cancer -- just about the most deadly, untreatable cancer you can get.</p><p>When my doctor at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles said the words "pancreatic cancer," a single thought popped into my mind: I'm a dead man. That's what I had always thought when I heard someone had pancreatic cancer, and it usually turned out to be true. My doctor told me that my chances of surviving for more than a few months weren't high, and I had no reason to doubt him.<br></p><p>A lot of things go through your head when you get a death sentence handed to you, starting with <i>Why me? What did I do to deserve this? </i>Once the shock wears off, it's hard not to sink into bitterness, to feel that you've been singled out in a way that's not fair. For me, that initial shock quickly turned to selfcriticism and blame. <i>Did I do this to myself? What could I have done differently? Is it my fault?</i></p><p>In those first few weeks after my diagnosis, amid the whirlwind of figuring out treatments and medication, I struggled, with Lisa's help, to make sense of what was happening to me. Trying to counteract all the negative emotions that kept welling up -- anger, bitterness, despair -- I began thinking to myself, <i>I've had more lifetimes than any ten people put together, and it's been an amazing ride. So this is okay.</i></p><p>I was trying to find a way to accept what was going on, but then a funny thing happened. I just couldn't. I wasn't ready to go, and I was damned if this disease was going to take me before I was good and ready. So I said to my doctor, "Show me where the enemy is, and I will fight him." I wanted to understand exactly what I was up against so I could go after this cancer rather than waiting for it to beat me. And in the year and a half since my diagnosis, that's exactly what I've done, with every ounce of energy I have.</p><p>Fighting cancer has been the most challenging and eyeopening experience I've ever had, and it has sent me on an emotional journey deeper than anything I've felt before. Facing your own mortality is the quickest way possible to find out what you're made of. It strips away all the bullshit and exposes every part of you -- your strengths and weaknesses, your sense of self. Your soul.</p><p>It also leads you to confront life's hardest questions: Is there a heaven? Will I make it in? Has this life counted for something other than just my own narcissism? Have I lived a good life? Am I a good person? It's easy to dismiss these difficult questions when you have your whole life ahead of you. But when you're faced with your own mortality, they suddenly take on a whole new meaning.</p><p>There's a scene at the end of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> that really resonated with me when I first saw it, and it does now more than ever. As an old man, Private Ryan muses aloud about whether he's lived a good life. "I tried to live my life the best I could," he says. "I hope that was enough." It's so hard to judge your own life, to know whether you've made a mark in this world. Doing this book was, in part, a quest to find that out for myself.</p><p>I've never been one to spend a lot of time dwelling in the past, so spending time with Lisa looking back at our lives has been really illuminating. Especially in light of what our future now holds, it has also been cathartic. I never felt like I had all the answers, and I certainly don't claim to now. Yet the one thing I realized as Lisa and I retraced the arc of our lives is that no matter what happened, we never, ever gave up -- on each other, or on our dreams. I'm far from perfect, and I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. But that's one thing we both got right, and it's the one thing that's keeping me going today.</p><p>As I write this, sitting in our beautiful ranch home in New Mexico with the sun beaming down on the mountains, I realize yet again how much more I want to do in this life. Together with Lisa, I'll keep on pushing, keep on believing. Because that, in the end, is the greatest gift we have.</p><p><i>Patrick Swayze<br>June 2009</i><br></p><p>As Patrick and I have been writing this book, I couldn't help but be amazed by all the stories of things we've done and been through. It was surprising to me how hard we've both worked our whole lives, how focused and single-minded we could be. It must be the dancer in us. Always striving to be more, do better, never settle. And that drive to be better has served us well, particularly with all that we're going through now.</p><p>Looking back now, I wish I had done more of the proverbial "stop and smell the roses." So many gorgeous, beautiful things have happened in my life and I was too busy moving forward to really, truly recognize and enjoy them. I'm feeling different these days. Today I find myself much more willing to take luxurious, selfish pleasure in how beautiful a day is, the wonderful smell of my favorite mare's hair, and how much overflowing love I feel for my husband.</p><p>After Patrick was first diagnosed, I found myself wanting to go back in time and fix all the bumps that we had ever encountered. I wished we could start all over again so that this time we could do it differently. We could be wiser, avoid all those wrong turns we made, and not waste so much time. This time we would laugh more, touch each other more, and simply love each other in the way our true selves always have. And of course, if this daydream came true, I'd get a chance to live our lives together all over again, fulfilling my greatest wish -- to have more time with him.</p><p>In some ways, getting to do this book gave me a passport into the past. But not in the way I had thought. It couldn't elongate my time with him, but it did show me that some of those bumps I wished I could get rid of don't look so bad when we keep coming out on the other side. And they're a testament to the strength of what we are together.</p><p>You'd think that when someone close to you receives a death sentence it would inspire amazing insights and lessons about life. I know that's what I thought. But after his diagnosis, and after I started to recover from feeling I was trapped in a perpetual nightmare, I looked around and couldn't see a damn lesson in sight. Yet slowly, as I've been dealing with getting past the initial grief and fear, living each day that comes and running around preparing for all the things one can't possibly prepare for, the lessons have started to ease out into the open. I couldn't force them out any sooner. They come in their own time when they, and you, are good and ready.</p><p>There's a lot of wisdom in the idea of living one day at a time. And when you might not have someone for long, that's what starts to happen.</p><p>I used to be afraid of time -- that I'd run out of it, that I wouldn't have time to do all the things I wanted. Now I'm seeing each minute that passes as a victory. As something I'm proud of. It's like I can gather all these minutes into my arms as if they're an enormous mass of jewels. Look what I have -- another moment! A kiss, a stroke of the skin on my husband's arm, the light coming through the window just so...Each of these jewels gives me the confidence to stand up and look Death in the face and say, "No one's going anywhere today."</p><p>I can help Patrick -- I can coach him, love him, track his medications and calories, be there to kick him in the pants or just hold his hand if he needs it. But I can't save him. And I try to remember that. But I've got the best possible thing on my side: Patrick himself. I love that he's such a fighter. He's so amazingly strong and beautiful. He's my best weapon against this terrible disease.</p><p>You know, we were in New Mexico a couple of years after Patrick had broken both his legs in a life-threatening horse accident while filming <i>Letters from a Killer.</i> We walked out into the fresh mountain air, and he had taken off his shirt to enjoy the sun as we strolled into our beautiful fifty-acre pasture to visit with our five spirited Arabian horses. Patrick was rubbing one of the horses on her neck and I had walked off a ways for some reason or another. And I turned around just in time to see him grab a handful of mane and swing himself up on the mare's back. No saddle, no bridle, nothing.</p><p>She and the other horses started to trot off together and then, in a tight group, they launched into a full gallop, Patrick riding bareback in the middle of them through the open field. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't help but see how fantastic and free he looked. And I couldn't help but be piss...</p></p><h2>Hitler and Stalin : Parallel Lives</h2><p>Cover has moderate wear, creases front and back.

So grab your graphing calculators, slip out the slide rules, and buckle up! John Derbyshire is introducing us to algebra through the ages -- and it promises to be just what his die-hard fans have been waiting for. "Here is the story of algebra." With this deceptively simple introduction, we begin our journey. Flanked by formulae, shadowed by roots and radicals, escorted by an expert who navigates unerringly on our behalf, we are guaranteed safe passage through even the most treacherous mathematical terrain. Our first encounter with algebraic arithmetic takes us back 38 centuries to the time of Abraham and Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, Ur and Haran, Sodom and Gomorrah. Moving deftly from Abel's proof to the higher levels of abstraction developed by Galois, we are eventually introduced to what algebraists have been focusing on during the last century. As we travel through the ages, it becomes apparent that the invention of algebra was more than the start of a specific discipline of mathematics -- it was also the birth of a new way of thinking that clarified both basic numeric concepts as well as our perception of the world around us. Algebraists broke new ground when they discarded the simple search for solutions to equations and concentrated instead on abstract groups. This dramatic shift in thinking revolutionized mathematics. Written for those among us who are unencumbered by a fear of formulae, <i>Unknown Quantity</i> delivers on its promise to present a history of algebra. Astonishing in its bold presentation of the math and graced with narrative authority, our journey through the world of algebra is at once intellectually satisfying and pleasantly challenging.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>Introduction</li><li>Part 1 The Unknown Quantity -1 Four Thousand Years Ago</li><li>2 The Father of Algebra</li><li>3 Completion and Reduction</li><li>Math Primer: Cubic and Quartic Equations</li><li>4 Commerce and Competition</li><li>5 Relief for the Imagination</li><li>Part 2 Universal Arithmetic - 6 The Lion\'s Claw</li><li>Math Primer: Roots of Unity</li><li>7 The Assault on the Quintic</li><li>Math Primer: Vector Spaces and Algebras</li><li>8 The Leap into the Fourth Dimension</li><li>9 An Oblong Arrangement of Terms</li><li>10 Victoria\'s Brumous Isles</li><li>Part 3 Levels of Abstraction - Math Primer: Field Theory</li><li>11 Pistols at Dawn</li><li>12 Lady of the Rings</li><li>Math Primer: Algebraic Geometry</li><li>13 Geometry Makes a Comeback</li><li>14 Algebraic This, Algebraic That</li><li>15 From Universal Arithmetic to Universal Algebra</li><li>Endnotes</li><li>Picture Credits</li><li>Index</li><li>Photos, Illustrations, and Drawings</li></ul></p><p>John Derbyshire is a mathematician and linguist by education, a systems analyst by profession, and the celebrated author of Prime Obsession, his no-holds-barred mathematical biography of Bernhard Riemann, and the highly acclaimed 1996 novel Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream. His work appears frequently in National Review and The New Criterion. He currently lives in Huntington, New York, with his wife and two children.This book's title is deceiving, for Derbyshire offers a very real and very entertaining survey of the development of algebra. "Real" and "imaginary" refer to types of numbers, and Derbyshire (<i>Prime Obsession</i>) opens with a basic primer on the various flavors of numbers and polynomials before looking at algebra's development over 3,000 years. As he explains how algebraic notation wended its way from Sumerian scratches on clay to such contemporary mathematical structures as Calabi-Yau manifolds (used by Andrew Wiles to solve Fermat's Last Theorem), Derbyshire introduces readers to the colorful figures who made contributions: Hypatia, whose death in Alexandria at the hands of an angry Christian mob marked the end of mathematics in the ancient world; 19th-century mathematician Hermann Grassmann, who published a 3,000-page translation of the ancient Hindu text the Rig Veda after his work on vector spaces was ignored; and Emanuel Lasker, more famous as the longest-reigning world chess champion than for his contributions to ring theory. This book will appeal to readers who relished the rigorous mathematical discursions interspersed with informal historical vignettes of David Berlinski's <i>A Tour of the Calculus</i>, but less mathematically inclined readers more interested in the history of science will also enjoy it. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Richard Frye&#x2019;s translation from the Persian presents an engaging, readable narrative that recreates the lively intellectual and commercial life of this vibrant ancient city. In the tenth century, Bukhara was a cultural center that rivaled Baghdad, and was known as &#x201c;the dome of learning in the East.&#x201d; It was a dynamic metropolis, capital of the semi-independent dynasty that ruled most of present-day Iran and Central Asia. It was in Bukhara that the so-called Persian Renaissance began, with its far-reaching literary implications. Al-Narshakhi portrays not only rulers, but also everyday life in cities and villages. This primary source affords insights into life in Eastern Iran and Central Asia during a period of change in the Islamic world.</p><p></p><h2>The Genius of Leonardo</h2><p>Bimba Landmann s richly colored iconographic illustrations both illuminate this stunning life of Leonardo and create an air of mystery around this far-reaching genius. At once instructive and entertaining, the story is told by ten-year-old Giacomo, who comes to respect, love, and learn from Leonardo, his wise and eccentric master. The many facets of this towering genius of Renaissance Italy are explored in a book that will inspire everyone to search for their own greatness within.</p><p>This engaging picture-book biography of Leonardo da Vinci is told from the perspective of his 10-year-old assistant, Giacomo. He looks on in wonder as Leonardo paints the Mona Lisa, designs a flying machine--and, less impressively, plays practical jokes on him. The basics of Leonardo's life are all here, including his habit of buying and releasing caged birds and his reluctant move, late in life, to the French court. But young readers will learn most about da Vinci's ideas--on painting, science, and the nature of time. Cleverly interleaved with short quotations from the master's own writings, <i>The Genius of Leonardo</i> leaves a vivid impression of what it must have been like for a child to be an apprentice to such a genius. A nice touch is that Leonardo doesn't know everything: Giacomo's last question, about the moon, is beyond him, and Leonardo's assistant is left to speculate about knowledge and inventions yet to come. As in the spectacular <i>A Boy Named Giotto</i>, Bimba Landmann's gorgeous paintings are melancholy and oddly--but strangely aptly--medieval looking.

Warm and hard-wearing, they can be made from recycled clothing, blankets, or any other scrap textiles. Designs and colors vary from subtle natural patterns to bold, bright compositions, all displaying the unique versatility of the craft. In Rag Rugs, Ann Davies explains the various techniques, including the hand techniques of hooky and proddy and the plethora of gadgets designed to make the job easier. Highly illustrated with 120 color photos as well as diagrams, the book includes advice on dyeing fabrics in the microwave, cutting by hand and other methods, and working with and without a frame; it also looks at various backing materials and methods of finishing edges. Providing an excellent overview of the work of modern rag rug makers, this book will also be of interest to textile artists.</p><p>Strips of recycled clothing and other fabrics are the raw materials for the rugs in these two books. Davies (How To Make Hand-Hooked Rag Rugs) covers hooked rugs and several related types, with detailed information on materials, tools, and dyeing.

That was the idea behind <i>Art: 21: Art in the Twenty-First Century</i>. Each of the four essayists takes one topic--place, spirituality, identity, or consumption--as the launching point for discussions of a varied group of American artists. Produced to accompany a PBS television series, this amply illustrated book embraces art ranging from the sexually charged sculptures of Louise Bourgeois (born in 1911) to paintings by Michael Ray Charles (born in 1967) that rework black stereotypes into ironic commentaries. The artists are certainly worthy, and it's no big deal that the art is nearly all from the 20th century (not, as the title suggests, the 21st). But the thematic approach works better for some artists than for others, and the effort to be inclusive makes for vague and awkward writing. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>Robert Storr is senior curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. <br>Thelma Golden is deputy director for exhibitions and programs at the Studio Museum of Harlem, New York. <br>Katy Siegel is assistant professor of art history at Hunter College, New York. <br>Lynn M.

Only through the stories of the common people who struggled during that era can we really understand how the nation endured. In <em>The Forgotten Man</em>, Amity Shlaes offers a striking reinterpretation of the Great Depression. Rejecting the old emphasis on the New Deal, she turns to the neglected and moving stories of individual Americans, and shows how they helped establish the steadfast character we developed as a nation.</p><p>Shlaes also traces the mounting agony of the New Dealers themselves as they discovered their errors. She shows how both Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt failed to understand the prosperity of the 1920s and heaped massive burdens on the country that more than offset the benefit of New Deal programs. The real question about the Depression, she argues, is not whether Roosevelt ended it with World War II. It is why the Depression lasted so long. From 1929 to 1940, federal intervention helped to make the Depression great&#x2014;in part by forgetting the men and women who sought to help one another. <em>The Forgotten Man</em>, offers a new look at one of the most important periods in our history, allowing us to understand the strength of American character today. </p></p><p><p>Amity Shlaes is the author of four <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers: <em>The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression</em>, <em>The Forgotten Man/Graphic</em>, <em>Coolidge</em>, and <em>The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Miss Shlaes chairs the board of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation and the Manhattan Institute's Hayek Book Prize, and serves as a scholar at the King's College. A former member of the <em>Wall Street Journal's </em>editorial board, Miss Shlaes published a weekly syndicated column for more than a decade, appearing first in the <em>Financial Times</em>, then in <em>Bloomberg</em>.&nbsp;</p><p></p>Terence Aselford does an excellent job with Shlaess revisionist account of the Great Depression. He narrates in a lively manner and manages to maintain clarity during the authors interesting, but lengthy, digressions. Listeners will meet many men, and some women, who were once household names but are now hardly remembered, including New Dealers Tugwell, Perkins, Wallace, and Wendel Willke, who ran for president against Roosevelt in 1940. Shlaes interweaves informative mini-biographies of these and many of the periods major political characters, forming a reconsideration of the causes of the Great Depression and the relative effectiveness of the New Deal. This is a genuinely interesting story well told.

From the book: &#34;Deep beneath the heart of Los Angeles&#39; financial district, hundreds of feet below the huge edifices that house banks, corporate offices, and government agencies, lies another city remembered only in obscure Indian legends, an underground world built by a strange race that vanished five thousand years ago. &#34;At least that&#39;s what mining engineer W. Warren Shufelt claimed in the January 29, 1934 Los Angeles Times. According to reporter Jean Bosquet, Shufelt was ready to dig up downtown L.A. in search of this ancient civilization. &#34;Shufelt had first heard of the city in a Hopi legend about &#34;the Lizard People.&#34; They were a fabled lost race who had built 13 great underground cities on the Pacific Coast after a huge holocaust swept the Southwest back around 3,000 BC.... &#34;A Hopi chief told Shufelt that the vanished race&#39;s capital city was located under present-day downtown Los Angeles. After surveying the area, Shufelt showed up on the Banning property at North Hill Street and sank a 350-foot shaft straight down, digging for what he said was a `treasure room&#39; directly underneath. Shufelt said he had located gold in the catacombs below with the aid of his `radio x-ray&#39;.... &#34;He said that the subterranean city was shaped like a giant lizard, with the tail tapering out beneath the Central Library, and the head in the vicinity of Chavez Ravine (now Dodger Stadium). The `key room,&#39; the chamber that contained the map of the city and the directory to the gold tablets, lay several hundred feet under the present site of Times-Mirror Square....&#34;</p><h2>Last Forbidden Kingdom</h2><p>Closed to foreigners for more than 30 years, Mustang, a tiny feudal kingdom in the Himalayas, has existed in virtual isolation from the rest of the world. Although politically part of Nepal, Mustang is linked by religion, culture and history to Tibet, and stands alone as one of the last pure Tibetan cultures existing today. In 1992 restrictions were eased. Clara Marullo and Vanessa Boeye were among the few foreigners who made the journey to Mustang. This book is an account of their journey, and a view of the society that exists there. With its photographs, it also acts as a visual record of the landscape in this country. However, this is an environment under threat. Now open to the West, the landsape and all that is contained in it is open to change, and the survival of Mustang&#39;s ancient traditions is questionable. The final part of the book examines the potential problems of modernization and highlights the need to protect Mustang from the influences of tourism.</p><p>Tibetan culture is threatened with extinction at the hands of the Chinese, but there is one relatively intact outpost: the tiny mountain desert kingdom of Mustang. Nearly unchanged by time or politics, Mustang juts up into western Tibet, stark, grand, and, until very recently, sealed off from the rest of the world. Marullo surveys Mustang history, both natural and human, describing the land, the culture, and the spectacular monasteries filled with masterpieces of Tibetan religious art. Here, as Marullo explains, "Buddhism is less a faith than a metaphysic, and as such underlies every aspect of life." To survive in a place as remote as this, where the mountains are so immense and close to heaven they are unquestionably sacred, a society must achieve balance and harmony with nature, and indeed the people of Mustang are resourceful and strong. But now that Mustang's borders have been partially opened by China, Mustang's hold on what is left of Tibetan culture has become even more tenuous. Perhaps this book, with its luminous, dramatic, and richly detailed photographs, will help outsiders understand Mustang's plight. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Power from on High: The Development of Mormon Priesthood</h2><p>&nbsp;Authority and priesthood were concepts that developed gradually in Mormon theology, not as thunderbolts but as ideas that acquired meaning and momentum over time. Acting initially on the basis of implied leadership, Joseph Smith moved toward explicit angelic authority and an increasingly defined structure drawn from biblical models.<p>All the while the structure of higher and lower priesthoods fluctuated in response to pragmatic needs. Priests were needed to perform ordinances, teachers to lead congregations, bishops to manage church assets, and elders to proselytize&#x2013;responsibilities which would be redistributed repeatedly throughout Smith&#x2019;s fourteen-year ministry.</p><p>Gregory Prince charts these developments with impressive interpretative skill. Besides the obvious historical significance, he underscores the implications for current Mormon governance. For instance, where innovations have characterized the past, one need not be bound by custom or surprised when church leaders instigate change.</p></p><p>&nbsp;Gregory A. Prince is the director of pharmaceutical research for Virion Systems in Maryland, a visiting professor of pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine, and a research professor of pediatrics at the armed forces University of Health Sciences (USHUS). He is the author of&nbsp;Having Authority: The Origins and Development of Priesthood During the Ministry of Joseph Smith,&nbsp;Power From On High: The Development of Mormon Priesthood, and&nbsp;David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism.&nbsp;Chapter One<p>Authority</p><p>A revelation to the three-year-old Church of Christ (also called Mormon) declared in 1833 that God would &#x201c;give unto the faithful line upon line precept upon precept.&#x201d;1The concept of authority was not initially addressed in the Restoration movement2but developed gradually, or &#x201c;line upon line.&#x201d; Now viewed as the founding Restoration event, the epiphany known as the &#x201c;first vision&#x201d; resulted from Joseph Smith&#x2019;s mourning &#x201c;for my own sins and for the sins of the world.&#x201d;3&nbsp;In response, &#x201c;the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee.&#x201d; Despite the importance attached to the first vision by subsequent generations of Latter-day Saints, it did not serve as Smith&#x2019;s call to the ministry or claim to divine authorization.</p><p>That claim began with another vision, in the autumn of 1823, when &#x201c;an angel of the Lord came and stood before me.&#x201d; The angel called Moroni entrusted to Smith &#x201c;plates of gold upon which there was engravings which was engraven by Maroni &amp; his fathers the servants of the living God in ancient days and deposited by the commandments of God and kept by the power thereof and that I should go and get them.&#x201d;4&nbsp;Translating the plates into the Book of Mormon marked the beginning of Smith&#x2019;s ministry. It established among his followers his credentials as a prophet. Such authority, however, was implied, for Smith never claimed that Moroni bestowed formal authority by the laying on of hands, the manner sanctioned by ancient and modern Christianity.</p><p>As the Mormon restoration unfolded, the essence of divine empowerment assumed a more concrete form. Almost six years after Moroni&#x2019;s visit, angelic beings bestowed authority on Smith and his assistant Oliver Cowdery by the laying on of hands. Although in the Mormon church today the term &#x201c;priesthood&#x201d; refers to this bestowed authority, such a relationship did not develop until years after the founding of the church. Initially authority was understood to be inherent in what are now termed &#x201c;offices.&#x201d; Three offices&#x2014;elder, priest, and teacher&#x2014;were present by August 1829, as were the ordinances of baptism, confirmation, and ordination, but the word &#x201c;priesthood&#x201d; was not used in reference to these for another three years.</p><p>In June 1831 a modern &#x201c;pentecost&#x201d; occurred in which supernatural powers, similar to those reported in the New Testament book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2, were bestowed upon latter-day disciples through their ordination to the &#x201c;high priesthood,&#x201d; thus coupling the concepts of &#x201c;authority&#x201d; and &#x201c;power.&#x201d; Between 1831 and 1835 an organizational consolidation occurred, resulting in the 1835 designation of the &#x201c;Aaronic Priesthood&#x201d; and &#x201c;Melchizedek Priesthood,&#x201d; which incorporated the elements of authority and power which had developed over the prior dozen years.</p><p>Perhaps the most important and certainly least understood development began in 1836 when Smith and Cowdery recorded a vision of Elijah, the Old Testament prophet. Although Elijah did not become associated with priesthood for another two years, he gradually became the most important figure for Latter-day Saint authority. Indeed, after 1840 Smith never associated Moroni, John the Baptist, or Peter, James, and John&#x2014;previous angelic ministers&#x2014;with the concept of priesthood, opting instead to emphasize Elijah.</p><p>The concept of bestowed authority was present prior to the organization of the church, but the structure and nomenclature developed gradually throughout the remaining years of Smith&#x2019;s life. Although the development occurred along a continuum, the continuity was punctuated by several key events.

Here, the western allies, including mages and the Sun-priest Karal, look desperately among the exotic machines in the Tower of Urtho, the Mage of Silence, for a way to stop the storms; elsewhere, in Hardorn, Duke Tremane is offered the kingship, contingent upon a primitive ritual that will tie his fate to that of the land. Emperor Charliss declares Tremane a traitor and names Baron Melles his heir, allowing Melles new latitude for infamy. Many familiar characters from Lackey's previous books are here, as well as some impressive new ones, including a gryphon delegation from Iftel.

By the author of Whisper to Me of Love. Original.</p><p>When Blas Davalos dies in Spanish Texas in 1804, his last words concern the fortune of Aztec gold he wanted to leave to his young illegitimate daughter, Savanna O'Rourke. But the fortune is in the hands of Blas's archenemy, Jason Savage. Ten years later, Savanna is eking out an existence running a backwoods tavern near New Orleans. Faced with the continual threat of ambush by "Murdering" Micajah Yates, Savanna agrees to return to the family plantation to a safe (and to Savanna, stifling) life with her mother. Her quiet sojourn there ends, however, when Micajah--who has learned of Blas's supposed fortune--kidnaps her in the hope that she will provide clues to finding it. He also abducts Jason's half-brother, Adam St. Clair, and the two captives warily join forces against Micajah, securing their freedom but finding it difficult to reconcile their families' longstanding feud with their desire for each other. As the novel plods relentlessly toward its unsurprising conclusion, it does provide some distraction with well-sketched scenes of plantation life in a lush, only partially settled Louisiana, but in the end Busbee's ( Whisper to Me of Love ) romance is burdened with an implausible and at times unwieldy plot. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>GOODNIGHT, IRENE</h2><p>&#39;Goodnight, Irene&#39; features a collection of Carol Lay&#39;s &#39;Irene&#39; strips from &#39;Good Girls&#39; comics - which originally appeared in 1980 - including 23 pages that have never been published before.</p><p>Carol Lay is the author of a weekly comic strip, WayLay, which first appeared in 1992 and runs in the LA Weekly, salon.com and in daily and weekly newspapers as far afield as Hong Kong and Norway.

As a child, Ann was her photographer father&#39;s muse, and his controversial photographs of her shocked the world.

She has written two biographies, <i>Saint Th�r�se of Lisieux </i>and <i>Joan of Arc, </i>and a book of true crime, <i>While They Slept: An Inquiry into the Murder of a Family. </i>She lives in Brooklyn with her husband, the novelist Colin Harrison.Harrison's second novel (after Thicker Than Water ) is a mesmerizing depiction of a woman on the edge of emotional disintegration. Ann Rogers is a beautiful, chic, financially comfortable New Yorker with a career as a videographer of weddings and society functions, and a loving husband who restores landmark buildings. But Ann is addicted to speed, a drug which holds especially dangerous consequences for her, since she is a diabetic. Moreover, every time she does crystal meth, she compulsively shoplifts at Bergdorf's and Saks. Flashing back to Ann's Texas upbringing, Harrison gradually discloses the source of her deep neuroses. Her cold, monstrously selfish father extracted a bizarre kind of vengeance for her mother's death in childbirth. Edgar Rogers became famous for his photographs of a prepubescent and adolescent Ann, naked and assuming deathly poses. He committed suicide in 1979; now a retrospective of his work, including photos of Ann engaged in acts the memory of which she has tried to repress, is imminent at the MoMA. Demonstrating impressive control of the novel's structure and pacing, Harrison steadily deepens her sophisticated psychological portrait of Ann while elevating suspense and the reader's emotional involvement. The shocking circumstances of Ann's life become clear: she survived traumatic events by pathologically retreating into herself, but her subconscious erupts now and then in suicidal behavior. This unsparing picture of a woman spinning out of control is conveyed in luminous and tensile prose. The novel's larger theme, an indictment of a society "which encourages exploitation even as it punishes all who chronicle it," is eerily prescient, calling to mind the current controversy over photographer Sally Mann's nude pictures of her children. Harrowing but spellbinding, the novel has the impact of an unforgettably vivid image seared on the eye.

Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts)</h2><p><p>In <i>Painting as an Art</i>, which began as the 1984 Andrew Mellon Lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., philosopher Richard Wollheim transcended the boundaries and habits of both philosophy and art history to produce a large, encompassing vision of viewing art. Wollheim had three great passions--philosophy, psychology, art--and his work attempted to unify them into a theory of the experience of art. He believed that unlocking the meaning of a painting involved retrieving, almost reenacting, the creative activity that produced it.</p><p>In order to fully appreciate a work of art, Wollheim argued, critics must bring to the understanding of a work of art a much richer conception of human psychology than they have in the past: "Many [critics] . . . make do with a psychology that, if they tried to live their lives by it, would leave them at the end of an ordinary day without lovers, friends, or any insight into how this came about." Many reviewers have remarked on the insightfulness of the book's final chapter, in which Wollheim contended that certain paintings by Titian, Bellini, de Kooning, and others represent the painters' attempts to project fantasies about the human body onto the canvas.</p><p> Reviewing the book in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Daniel A. Herwitz asserted that Wollheim had "done no less than recover for psychology its obvious and irresistible place in the explanation of what is most profound and subtle about paintings."</p></p><p>"It is one of the achievements of Richard Wollheim's superb book that it offers an extremely subtle sense of the mind's functioning, while providing a theory of critical relevance: it shows how psychological and cultural factors enter a painting's content, and how arguments on relevance can be conducted in difficult cases."<b>---Michael Podro, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>"There are books aplenty on painting and art, but this is the first to explain seriously what makes painting an art, and it is our good luck to have it from a notable philosopher who is also on an intimate footing with the tradition of Western painting and who knows how to stand in front of a painting and spin tales that sparkle with truth. . . . Mr. Wollheim's interpretations are bold, revisionary and cogent. Only a philosopher of his rare gifts, and a connoisseur with his command of the art-historical tradition, could possibly have the confidence to bring off his feat of virtuoso interpretation."<b>---Flint Schier, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b>Wollheim notes that De Kooning crammed his pictures with the infantile experiences of sucking, touching, biting, excreting and swallowing. The expressionist's violent paintings are about the body as locus of sensation and emotion; they remind us that, as children, we felt threatened by our own natural bodily functions. Penetrating insights like these pepper the difficult lectures presented here along with some 400 illustrations. Wollheim, a philosopher of esthetics, offers a psychological theory of how pictures transmit meaning: artists act as agents, inducing in the mind of the spectator the mental states that compel them to paint. The author's favorites include Manet, Picasso, Titian, Bellini, Ingres, Poussin. These essays will help readers identify the unrepresented "internal spectator" lurking in some pictures; with other paintings, one discovers how the artist wanted the external spectator to feel. Wollheim delivered this set of lectures at the National Gallery of Art. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Voyages: A Travel Journal (Notebook, Diary) (Suedel Journals)</h2><p><p>With its soft, suede-textured spine and classic cover image of the Eiffel Tower, this elegant journal/diary is the perfect companion for your next adventure.<br></p><p></p><ul><li>Quotations by well-known travelers throughout will guide you as you record your own journey.</li><li>Endsheet and interior images of antique maps and parchment-look pages with compass rose images add to the journal's rich feel.</li><li>Covered wire-o binding; journal lies flat for ease of use.</li><li>160 lined pages</li><li>Hardcover</li><li> Elastic-band place holder</li><li>6-1/4'' wide x 8-1/4'' high<p></p></li></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Idea of Wilderness: From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology</h2><p>In this book Max Oelschlaeger argues that the idea of wilderness has reflected the evolving character of human existence from paleolithic times to the present day. An intellectual history, it draws together evidence from philosophy, anthropology, theology, literature, ecology, cultural geography, and archaeology to provide a scientifically and philosophically informed understanding of humankind&#39;s relationship to nature. Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, an idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to &#34;modernism&#34; arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold and he gives fresh readings of America&#39;s two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.</p><p>Former U.S. Secretary of the Interior James Watt may have seemed only a passing nightmare in his day, but he acted out of a very old tradition of American attitudes toward the land and its proper use. So did Henry David Thoreau. So did Edward Abbey. Americans have been arguing about the environment since the first boats landed at Jamestown, and by all appearances they'll keep right on arguing into the next millennium. <i>The Idea of Wilderness</i> packs the centuries-old story into a lively narrative with its full complement of heroes--Thoreau, John Muir, Aldo Leopold--a few choice villains of the robber-baron and bureaucrat persuasion, and a few middling souls like Gifford Pinchot, founder of the United States Forest Service. Max Oelschlaeger writes persuasively on the philosophical and religious underpinnings of various environmental positions, showing that indeed there's nothing new under the sun.How has the concept of wild nature changed over the millennia? And what have been the environmental consequences? In a wide-ranging work of intellectual history, Max Oelschlaeger presents a stimulating new examination of humankind&#39;s relationship with the natural world through the ages-from early totemism through Egyptian, Greco-Roman, and Judeo-Christian supernaturalism to the rise of materialism and modernism.</p><h2>Southern Living Party Cookbook Homestyle Entertaining with Family &amp; Friends: 161 Recipes Everyone Will Love</h2><p>This cookbook is full of wonderful recipes for all of your entertaining needs!</p><p></p><h2>Nature-Based Preschool Professional Practice Guidebook</h2><p><p>The Nature-Based Preschool Professional Practice Guidebook is the first resource to fully address the unique practices of nature-based early childhood education.

Most are the vulnerable legacy of three generations of the Bigham family, Scotch Irish stonecutters whose workshop near Charlotte created the earliest surviving art of British settlers in the region. In <i>The True Image</i>, Daniel Patterson documents the craftsmanship of this group and the current appearance of the stones. In two hundred of his photographs, he records these stones for future generations and compares their iconography and inscriptions with those of other early monuments in the United States, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.<br>Combining his reading of the stones with historical records, previous scholarship, and rich oral lore, Patterson throws new light on the complex culture and experience of the Scotch Irish in America. In so doing, he explores the bright and the dark sides of how they coped with challenges such as backwoods conditions, religious upheavals, war, political conflicts, slavery, and land speculation. He shows that headstones, resting quietly in old graveyards, can reveal fresh insights into the character and history of an influential immigrant group.<br><br></p><p>"Describes with clarity a great tradition, sets it in historical context, and accomplishes an historical ethnography of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians.

In this selection of over a hundred colour photographs, Harvey explores the exuberance and incongruities of a life and culture that hold for him an endless fascination. The photographs are presented within thematic chapters, each of which is introduced by Harvey&#39;s own commentary. The passionate and divided soul of the Hispanic world, where tradition and ritual are inherent to everyday life, is revealed in Harvey&#39;s evocative, and often contradictory, images: a pulsating carnival in Cuba&#39;s Trinidad, a fervent African tribal ceremony in Brazil, an erotic disco in Lisbon, a Whitsuntide procession in Andalucia and a first Communion in Mexico. Adopting an approach that combines intuition, patience and persistent curiosity - together with a rejection of cumbersome equipment - Harvey succeeds in minimizing the distance between himself and his subjects, producing images that capture the natural choreography of people within places and that resonate with magic.</p><p>David Alan Harvey (b.1944) has been a member of the prestigious Magnum photographic agency since 1996 and worked for National Geographic since the 1970s. He is a former National Press Photographers Association Magazine Photographer of the Year and won an Eisenstadt Award in 2000. Harvey has spent the past two decades exploring the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, producing poignant photographs of fleeting moments with a characteristically lyrical tone.&#39;Harvey&#39;s depictions of everyday situations, whether a vibrant street scene or a fishing trip at dawn, shimmer with colour and his seemingly oblivious subjects possess an almost ethereal quality.&#39; (Esquire) &#39;Whether you&#39;re an armchair traveller, a fan of Latin America or a wannabe photographer, Harvey&#39;s volume is well worth the spend.&#39; (Time Out Dubai)</p><h2>On Broken Glass: Loving and Losing John Gardner</h2><p>This intimate portrait of a major American writer explores his tumultuous creative life and is a candid memoir of a love affair cut short by his violent death. &#34;DIED. John Gardner, 49,&#34; read the Time magazine obituary, &#34;prolific author of stylistically adventuresome fiction, enthusiastic teacher and sometimes, messianic literary critic, of injuries sustained when he lost control of his motorcycle and crashed; near his home in Susquehanna, Pa., four days before he was to have married for the third time.&#34; The woman John Gardner was to have married that September of 1982 was a vivacious, talented young writer named Susan Thornton, and On Broken Glass is the story of her exhilarating and sometimes devastating relationship with the author of Grendel, Nickel Mountain, The Sunlight Dialogues, and the award-winning October Light. Poignantly recalled from that moment when she first meets the seductive Gardner at the Bread Loaf Writers&#39; Conference in 1979, with stinging emotional resonance Thornton&#39;s tale relates both the rapture of ardent physical love and the torments of adulterous deceit. It provides, too, an insider&#39;s view of the troubling events that surrounded Gardner&#39;s untimely death at the same time that it explores the scope of his genius and maps the downward spiral of a demon-ridden alcoholic life. Intimate letters never before published further illuminate the creative appetite and imaginative power of this accomplished, often controversial novelist. On Broken Glass stands as a testament to a love that endures betrayals, trials, and tragic loss. It also comprises a profoundly realized affirmation of life, of continuance, and unexpected peace.</p><p>SUSAN THORNTON has worked in journalism and higher education. Her literary fiction has been published in a number of journals. She lives in Binghamton, New York, with her husband and daughter.Aspects of Thornton's memoir of her tortured, passionate love affair with the charismatic, machoAand alcoholicAAmerican author John Gardner (October Light, which won the National Book Award, etc.) read like a novel. Thornton describes a fraught on-again off-again connection with Gardner that lasted three years, starting at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in 1979 when Thornton, herself a writer, was his student, until Gardner's fatal motorcycle accident in 1982. According to Thornton, their relationship was both exhilarating and dysfunctional, the two qualities frequently feeding each other. During their entire relationship, for example, Gardner maintained an intense intimacy with his wife, Liz, frequently calling her to tell her of his undying love. Thornton, now married and a mother, describes the difficulty in leaving this chapter of her life behind and in working through her idealization of Gardner. Her prose is careful and, at times, plain, bordering on banal; but she also exhibits flourishes of grace and originality, though she is reluctant to reveal much about herself. For instance, she mentions her own abuse of alcohol but gives few details, preferring to detail Gardner's addiction, and she offers little in the way of explanation for the extent of the masochism clearly present in their relationship. Despite the unevenness of her writing, Thornton has rendered an absorbing work; moreover, she contributes to literary scholarship by citing letters of Gardner's that, largely because she herself kept them private after his death, have not been available until now. 8 pages b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. (Dec.)

How can life writing do good, and how can it cause harm? The eleven essays in <i>The Ethics of Life Writing</i> explore such questions. They focus chiefly on autobiography and biography, but their findings apply to all "life writing"&#x2015;the entire class of literature in which people tell life stories. Their forms include case studies, diaries, ethnographies, interviews, and profiles. The essays are enhanced by an introduction that provides an overview of the volume, including a section on life writing vis-�-vis privacy and the law, and an afterword that looks at the essays in relation to one another.</p></p><p>Paul John Eakin is Ruth N.

He is the editor of <i>The Ethics of Life Writing</i>, also from Cornell; <i>On Autobiography</i> by Philippe Lejeune, and <i>American Autobiography: Retrospect and Prospect</i>.<p>"What is the nature of the author's obligation to her subject and to her audience? <i>The Ethics of Life Writing</i>, skillfully edited by Paul John Eakin, addresses this fundamental question. The book is the result of eleven prominent 'life writers' writing, presenting, arguing, and re-writing their ideas on the ethics of writing from real life.... Each essay in this collection motivated me to find a pen and underline the wisdom. Every writer who has ever asked, Do I feel right about this' will benefit from the reading of this book."</p> (<i>The Baltimore Review</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>The Ethics of Life Writing</i> is a rare collection of essays that finds new ground for the study of ethics. Some of the deepest matters of human self-understanding&#x2015;issues of justice and the human good&#x2015;lie at the heart of autobiography, which, in turn, is one of the most complex modes of human expression. To capture a life in writing has become a dominant literary form in the West, if not in the emerging global culture as a whole, and among the reading public there is a seemingly insatiable demand for intimacy, revelation, and disclosure. Life writing is a dynamic, protean form that involves the exercise of power and has the potential both to humanize and to corrupt. From the violations of others' privacy in narratives of self-discovery to the use of counter-ideals and counter-stories as a strategy of empowerment for those who live with illness or impairment, these essays explore the best of traditional and recent works. Taken together, they leave the reader much better equipped critically to evaluate this important genre."</p> (Bruce Jennings, Senior Research Scholar, The Hastings Center)<br><br><p>"Although Paul John Eakin is celebrated in the world of autobiography, the strength of this book comes from his having blended chapters by four major scholars of life writing with others by professors of religion, applied ethics, social anthropology, sociology, comparative literature, and philosophy. Eakin keeps the collection together both by allowing the authors to write from their individual perspectives and by bringing his expertise in life writing to bear on the collection as a whole."</p> (Timothy Dow Adams, author of <i>Telling Lies in Modern American Autobiography</i>)<br><br><p>"I recommend this excellent collection of arguments, meditations, moral confessions, and calls to action to anybody engaged in exploring the sticky complexities of life writing.

Jacqueline Rose stands back from the debates and looks instead at the swirl of controversy, recognizing it as a phenomenon in itself--one with much to tell us about how a culture selects and judges writers; how we hear women's voices; and how we receive messages from, to, and about our unconscious selves. </p></p><p>Jacqueline Rose has written and lectured widely on feminism, psychoanalysis and culture. She is the author of <i>The Case of Peter Pan, or The Impossibility of Children's Fiction</i>, <i>Sexuality in the Field of Vision</i>, <i>Why War? - psychoanalysis, politics and the return to Melanie Klein</i> and <i>States of Fantasy</i>, the 1994 Clarendon Lectures. <i>The Haunting of Sylvia Plath </i>received wide critical acclaim on its publication in 1991. She has a chair in English at Queen Mary University of London. She lives in London.<i> </i>As Rose demonstrates in her ambitious and original book, Plath has become one who 'haunts our culture'...Rose both reads Plath's writing for its multiplicity, its ghostly subtexts of ambiguity and fantasy, and discusses the ways in which she has become the object of critical fantasies and debates about femininity, violence and contemporary culture...Her goal is to repair both the blatant and the subtle editorial cuts made in the body of Plath's writing, to restore the poet's sexuality, anger and left-wing politics to the historical and aesthetic record...Rose's book is surely one of the most illuminating to date about the contradictions and the haunting power of the Plath legacy. (Elaine Showalter <i>London Review of Books</i>)<br><br>In her powerful new book, Jacqueline Rose refuses the temptation to lay claim to the 'truth' about Plath's work; in her illuminating readings of individual poems, she restores their ambiguity and sexuality, striving to 'stay with that anxiety and not resolve it.' (Voice Literary Supplement)<br><br>Working at the source, [Rose] transforms an existential dilemma (which is how most people read the Plath life and work) into a problem of knowledge. In a stroke, she redefines the debate...Her book is thrilling. (Manchester Guardian)<br><br><i>The Haunting of Sylvia Plath</i> gives us a new Sylvia Plath, even more troubling and contradictory and compelling than the one we thought we knew, and more important for the ways we understand literature and its place in twentieth-century culture. Rose's book--original, deftly-argued, and bold both in its perceptions and in the materials it chooses to include--will render most existing criticism of Plath obsolete.

Averil Cameron, an authority on later Roman and early Byzantine history and culture, captures the vigor and variety of the fourth century, doing full justice to the enormous explosion of recent scholarship. </p><p> After a hundred years of political turmoil, civil war, and invasion, the Roman Empire that Diocletian inherited in AD 284 desperately needed the radical restructuring he gave its government and defenses. His successor, Constantine, continued the revolution by adopting--for himself and the Empire--a vibrant new religion: Christianity. The fourth century is an era of wide cultural diversity, represented by figures as different as Julian the Apostate and St. Augustine. Cameron provides a vivid narrative of its events and explores central questions about the economy, social structure, urban life, and cultural multiplicity of the extended empire. Examining the transformation of the Roman world into a Christian culture, she takes note of the competition between Christianity and Neoplatonism. And she paints a lively picture of the new imperial city of Constantinople. By combining literary, artistic, and archaeological evidence. Cameron has produced an exciting record of social change. <i>The Later Roman Empire</i> is a compelling guide for anyone interested in the cultural development of late antiquity. </p></p><p>Professor Dame Averil Cameron was formerly the Warden of Keble College Oxford and the holder of a Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship in the Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford.Together these five compact volumes [<i>Early Greece</i> by Oswyn Murray, <i>Democracy and Classical Greece</i> by J.

As he pieces together his scattered images, we are brought back to a quiet, suburan street where two boys, Keith and his sidekick-Stephen-are engaged in their own version of the war effort: spying on the neighbors, recording their movements, ferreting out their secrets.<br><br>But when Keith utters six shocking words, the boys' game of espionage takes a sinister and unintended turn. A wife's simple errands and a family's ordinary rituals-once the focus of childish speculation-become the tragic elements of adult catastrophe.<br><br>In gripping prose, charged with emotional intensity, <i>Spies </i>reaches into the moral confusion of youth to reveal a reality filled with deceptions and betrayals, where the bonds of friendship, marriage, and family are unravelled by cowardice and erotic desire. Master illusionist Michael Frayn powerfully demonstrates, yet again, that what appears to be happening in front of our eyes often turns out to be something we can't see at all.<br></p><p>In Michael Frayn's novel <i>Spies</i> an old man returns to the scene of his seemingly ordinary suburban childhood. Stephen Wheatley is unsure of what he is seeking, but as he walks once-familiar streets he hasn't seen in 50 years, he unfolds a story of childish games colliding cruelly with adult realities. It is wartime and Stephen's friend Keith makes the momentous announcement that his mother is a German spy. The two boys begin to spy on the supposed spy, following her on her trips to the shops and to the post office, and reading her diary. Keith's mother does have secrets to conceal but they are not the ones the boys suspect. Frayn skillfully manipulates his plot so that the reader's growing awareness of the truth remains just a few steps beyond young Stephen's dawning realization that he is trespassing on painful and dangerous territory. The only false notes occur in the final chapter when the central revelation is too swiftly followed by further disclosures about Stephen and his family that seem somehow unnecessary and make the denouement less satisfyingly conclusive. This is a much sparer and less expansive book than Frayn's 1999 novel <i>Headlong</i>, which was short-listed for the Booker Prize. <i>--Nick Rennison, Amazon.co.uk</i>Michael Frayn is the author of nine novels, including the bestselling <i>Headlong</i>, which was a <i>New York Times </i>Editor's Choice selection and a Booker Prize finalist. He has also written thirteen plays, among them <i>Noises Off </i>and <i>Copenhagen</i>, which won three Tony Awards in 1999.

At a time of increased concern for the rights of their fellow citizens&#x2015;civil and political rights, as well as the social and economic rights that Great Society programs sought to secure&#x2015;many Americans saw inconsistencies between domestic and foreign policy and advocated for a new approach. The activism that arose from the upheavals of the 1960s fundamentally altered U.S. foreign policy&#x2015;yet previous accounts have often overlooked its crucial role.<br><br>In <i>From Selma to Moscow, </i>Sarah B. Snyder traces the influence of human rights activists and advances a new interpretation of U.S. foreign policy in the &#x201c;long 1960s.&#x201d; She shows how transnational connections and social movements spurred American activism that achieved legislation that curbed military and economic assistance to repressive governments, created institutions to monitor human rights around the world, and enshrined human rights in U.S. foreign policy making for years to come. Snyder analyzes how Americans responded to repression in the Soviet Union, racial discrimination in Southern Rhodesia, authoritarianism in South Korea, and coups in Greece and Chile. By highlighting the importance of nonstate and lower-level actors, Snyder shows how this activism established the networks and tactics critical to the institutionalization of human rights. A major work of international and transnational history, <i>From Selma to Moscow </i>reshapes our understanding of the role of human rights activism in transforming U.S. foreign policy in the 1960s and 1970s and highlights timely lessons for those seeking to promote a policy agenda resisted by the White House.</p><p>Sarah B. Snyder is a historian of U.S. foreign relations and an associate professor at American University&#x2019;s School of International Service. She is also the author of the award-winning <i>Human Rights Activism and the End of the Cold War: A Transnational History of the Helsinki Network</i> (2011).In this illuminating book Sarah Snyder explains the origins of the human rights movement in the 1960s and chronicles its evolution until the inauguration of Jimmy Carter. Linking the evolution of human rights to other social movements, she probes the motives, highlights the transnational connections, and analyzes the successes and failures of activists regarding human rights violations inside the Soviet Union, Southern Rhodesia, Greece, South Korea, and Chile. This book is an important contribution to the literature on human rights. (Melvyn Leffler, Edward Stettinius Professor of American History, University of Virginia)<br><br>In this impressive and deeply researched work, Sarah Snyder reveals the way global struggles over human rights became a feature of American politics and foreign policy in the 1960s and 70s as activists, journalists, and Congress members made the case that the United States was complicit if the country ignored brutal repression. An important contribution. (Mary L. Dudziak, Emory University School of Law)<br><br>Based on deep and thorough archival research, as well as an innovative and creative use of quantitative measures, Snyder&#x2019;s book demonstrates that issues of human rights emerged as a significant priority for many Americans, both political leaders and activists, well before the Carter administration. <i>From Selma to Moscow </i>is an extremely important contribution to what remains one of the most important challenges in American foreign policy. (Thomas Schwartz, Vanderbilt University)<br><br>Human rights is emerging as one of the central concerns of modern humanities and social science scholarship. <i>From Selma to Moscow</i> illuminates the missing links between histories of the 1940s and the 1970s, the focus of previous studies. Sarah Snyder&#x2019;s globe-spanning tale of activists and policy makers reveals the significance of the 1960s for bringing human rights to the forefront of U.S. foreign relations.

He loads the bases with the kind of entertaining anecdotes, minutiae, and quotes that separate baseball-and baseball writing-from other sports." <em>-- USA Today<br><br></em></strong>In the spring of 1946, Americans were ready to heal. The war was finally over, and as America's fathers and brothers were coming home so too were baseball's greats. Ted Williams, Stan Musial, and Joe DiMaggio returned with bats blazing, making the season a true classic that ended in a thrilling seven-game World Series. America also witnessed the beginning of a new era in baseball- it was a year of attendance records, the first year Yankee Stadium held night games, the last year the Green Monster wasn't green, and Jackie Robinson's first year playing in the Brooklyn Dodgers' system.<br><br>THE VICTORY SEASON thrillingly recounts these years of baseball and war, including the little-known "world series" that servicemen played in a captured Hitler Youth stadium in the fall of 1945. Robert Weintraub's extensive research and vibrant storytelling enliven the legendary season that embodies what we now think of as the game's golden era.</p><p>Robert Weintraub is the author of <i>The House That Ruth Built </i>and is a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times </i>sports pages. He is a sports columnist for <i>Slate</i>, and his writing has also aired on ESPN, ABC Sports, CBS Sports, and dozens of other outlets.

His excellent introduction puts forth the radical thesis that Jesus is best understood as a social reformer, a poor Jew in an occupied country who stressed social equality as much as or more than individual salvation. Attempting to see Christ not through 20th-century eyes but in the social, political, and economic context in which he lived and taught, Crossan points out that for the first 300 years after his crucifixion what was emphasized was not Jesus' divinity but his concern for communal empowerment. The picture that emerges is of a political and social rebel, a fearless champion to the poor and dispossessed. <p> Crossan's translations of Christ's sayings gathered from the four canonical gospels and the Gospel of Thomas are paradoxically both new and familiar, and their newness helps readers break outside their preconceived ideas of what they may consider to be "essential" about the revolutionary Galilean's message. Renderings such as "the somebodies will be nobodies and the nobodies will be somebodies" give well-known biblical verses renewed impact. Each saying stands alone and is meant to be read like poetry or dialectical argument, to be savored and enjoyed for its simultaneous simplicity and power. Scattered throughout the text are images of Jesus in Pre-Constantinian Christian reliefs and frescoes. Crossan explains that their emphasis on Jesus' concern with open healing and shared eating are further evidence of his radical social commitment. Those who are not afraid to challenge their assumptions about Jesus' teachings will find much of value in this volume. <i>--Uma Kukathas</i></p>John Dominic Crossan is Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies at DePaul University, Chicago. He has written twenty books on the historical Jesus in the last thirty years, four of which have become national religious bestsellers: The Historical Jesus (1991), Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography (1994), Who Killed Jesus?

Parker, as well as veterans of this series like Brendan DuBois, Michael Downs, Joyce Carol Oates, and Clark Howard, this edition will delight readers with its wide variety and peerless quality.</p><p>OTTO PENZLER is a renowned mystery&nbsp;editor, publisher, columnist, and owner of&nbsp;New York&#x2019;s The Mysterious Bookshop, the oldest and largest bookstore solely dedicated to mystery fiction.&nbsp;He has edited more than fifty crime-fiction anthologies. He lives in New York.Foreword<br><br>On a recent trip to one of the South"s literary meccas, Oxford, Mississippi, I <br>had the pleasure of spending a great deal of time with literary folks &#x2014; <br>authors, booksellers, editors, publishers, professors &#x2014; who take books and <br>writing very seriously. Included with visits to William Faulkner"s home, the <br>University of Mississippi"s special collections library, Square Books (at which <br>John Grisham happened to be doing a signing), were many hours spent with <br>good wine, cold beer, and conversation.<br> This wasn"t ordinary conversation, at least not to me. It was <br>among people who love literature as much as I do and who care about it <br>passionately. The talk swung freely: a writer is described as "a little full of <br>himself" but is then quickly conceded to be one of the best writers in the <br>state, a discussion immediately followed by a roundtable argument of which <br>of his books is the best and which is the worst, with more than one drinker &#x2014; <br>oops, I mean conversationalist &#x2014; cogently quoting beautiful lines from his <br>work.<br> The reason this discussion is appropriate (at least I think it is) is <br>that, without exception, those involved in the conversation love mystery <br>fiction. While one argued that Thomas Wolfe is a better writer than either <br>Faulkner or Hemingway (I excused him on the basis of his having consumed <br>nearly a case of Budweiser) and others tussled over whether Cormac <br>McCarthy is as good as or better than Faulkner (remember, this occurred in <br>Faulkner"s longtime home, so he was used as the measuring stick for all <br>American writers, although most of us know that Hemingway was the <br>greatest writer of the twentieth century, closely followed by Raymond <br>Chandler), there was agreement on one point. Mystery and crime fiction <br>ranks with the best literary production of these times, as it has for a long <br>time.<br> Every person engaged in these nightly confabs was acutely <br>familiar with this series of anthologies from Houghton Mifflin. A few of them <br>had work appear in its pages, and several were disappointed (permit me to <br>state it gently) that theirs hadn"t yet been selected. Not one of them is what <br>would be described as a "mystery writer." They were writing the best, most <br>powerful, passionate, realistic fiction that they knew how to do. Yet all had <br>written stories or novels in which murders or other criminal acts were <br>committed.<br> As has been true for the first five volumes in this series, the <br>twenty stories that make up this distinguished collection help broaden the <br>boundaries of mystery fiction, which I define as any work in which a crime or <br>the threat of a crime is central to the theme or the plot of the story. Detective <br>stories are merely one subgenre of this very wide-reaching literary form.<br> This year"s guest editor reflects that stretching of the borders. <br>James Ellroy, described by Joyce Carol Oates as "our American Dostoevski," <br>began his career as a writer of traditional mysteries, albeit with a hard edge <br>and an original prose style. His first book, Brown"s Requiem, is a private-eye <br>novel. His second, Clandestine, is a police novel, as are his next several <br>novels. Although the police, and even private eyes, continue to have a place <br>in his work, many layers of politics, jurisprudence, and social history have <br>been added. He has helped blur the lines between mystery fiction and <br>serious fiction &#x2014; as if they ever needed to be separated in the first place. The <br>suggestion that Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Horace McCoy, <br>Raymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald, and Robert B. Parker weren"t writing <br>social commentary while also writing first-rate mystery fiction means only <br>that the reader missed much of the point.<br> On a different subject, more or less, a word needs to be said <br>about the possibility of perceived favoritism, or nepotism, or some -ism or <br>another.<br> In addition to this series for Houghton Mifflin, I also edit other <br>mystery and crime anthologies and have done so for many years. These <br>other books are different in that I commission stories specifically for them. In <br>2001, those mystery anthologies had specific themes of baseball (Murderers" <br>Row) and boxing (Murder on the Ropes). It seems to me only natural that I <br>would request stories from authors I admire, which is what I did.<br> As the end of the year approached, I was looking for the best <br>original mysteries of the year; I could not ignore the books I edited nor the <br>authors who wrote for them. Sure enough, they produced some of the best <br>mystery stories of the year, and several of these stories will be found on <br>these pages, as Ellroy agreed that they were outstanding and deserved to be <br>here.<br> The danger of having too many stories on a single theme is that a <br>collection can seem to be too heavily weighted with a single type of story. <br>Find three boxing mysteries in one book and you"re going to think there"s an <br>awful lot of boxing around here. The same would be true if there were great <br>anthologies about perfume or blues or zebras (there are already too damned <br>many about cats, if you ask me).<br> This is not an apology, mind you, but an explanation. The fact of <br>the matter is that the boxing stories in this book are truly wonderful, and so <br>are the baseball stories. If anything, I may have been a bit tougher on some <br>of the authors who wrote for those anthologies because I was overly aware of <br>their origins. In this year"s anthology &#x2014; there"s no getting around it &#x2014; you <br>will get a disparate number of sports stories. However, I believe they are <br>among the most original and memorable stories that have ever appeared in <br>the six years of this series.<br> One more thing. The only criterion for selecting a story for this <br>book is the excellence of the writing. Last year"s book contained stories by <br>only a handful of authors with whom I was familiar. It"s different this year, as <br>some of fiction"s greatest names appear between these covers. When you <br>read these triumphs of superb prose, you will instantly see that they are here <br>because of how good they are, not because of who wrote them.<br> Enormous thanks and gratitude go to James Ellroy for taking the <br>time to work so dedicatedly on this volume. His introduction conveys a great <br>deal with the same alliterative and flamboyant flair that distinguishes his other <br>work, most recently The Cold Six Thousand, which appeared on the New <br>York Times bestseller list last year.<br> And of course, thanks to my colleague, Michele Slung, the <br>world"s best reader, without whom this annual volume would require three <br>years to complete. She culls the mystery fiction from all the magazines and <br>books with original fiction all year long so that I can read the likely suspects <br>and bring the list down to the top fifty, from which the guest editor then <br>selects the final twenty.<br> Despite reading every general consumer magazine and hundreds <br>of smaller periodicals, as well as books and the electronic publishing sites <br>that offer original fiction, we live in fear that, unlikely as it may be, we"ll miss <br>a worthy story. Therefore, if you are an author, editor, publisher, or someone <br>who cares about one and would like to submit a story, you are encouraged to <br>do so. A tearsheet or the entire publication is fine.<br> To be eligible, a story must have been written by an American or <br>Canadian and first published in a U.S. or Canadian book or periodical during <br>the calendar year 2002. If it was initially published in electronic format, you <br>must submit a hard copy. The earlier in the year I receive a story, the more <br>I"m inclined to welcome it with a happy heart, since reading more than a <br>hundred stories when the rest of the world is celebrating Christmas and the <br>entire holiday season (as occurred last year) makes me very Scrooge-like.<br> Please send submissions to Otto Penzler, The Mysterious <br>Bookshop, 129 West 56th Street, New York, New York 10019. Thanks.<br><br>O.P.<br>Introduction<br>The short story is the novel writ small. It"s reduced for revelation. Its features <br>are epiphany and lives in sharp duress. Miniaturization is difficult. It"s the <br>watchmaker"s trade revised for words.<br> I prefer the form of the novel. I dig the short story dictum of "every <br>word counts" in concert with the sweep of lives in deep duress. I"ve written <br>twelve novels and an equal number of short stories. The novels required years <br>of work. The short stories required more time per page, more time per <br>sentence, more time per word. An editor friend dragged me into the craft. I"m <br>glad he did.<br> The short story balances narrative line and characterization and <br>limits the scope of plot. The short story form teaches the novelist to conceive <br>more simply and condense the payoff. The short story form taught me to <br>think more surely and directly. The short story form taught me to assume the <br>reader"s perspective and curtail my reliance on plot. The short story form <br>taught me to gauge thematically and employ brevity to make my characters <br>pop.<br> My editor friend brought me to the medium kicking and <br>screaming. I owed him favors. My commitment to the short story paid off the <br>debt. The debt proved to be a gift disguised as hard work. The short story is <br>the novelist"s alternative universe. It"s a respite from sustained concentration <br>and a crash course in concentrating that much harder in the moment. It"s a <br>reprieve from the vast borders of scope and a primer on scope contained. It"s <br>the watchmaker"s trade taught to architects and large-scale engineers.<br> Plot and character must merge and meld quickly. Revelation must <br>grab and hold hard. A world must build from overt phrase and implication. <br>Balance must fall perfectly.<br> The mystery short story is a craft within a craft. The necessity for <br>plot makes that balance tough. Mystery fiction is crime fiction. Crime fiction <br>is mainstream fiction possessed of superior story-line and equal character-<br>development skill. Casting plot-nets wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide is relatively easy. <br>Constricting them to short story dimensions makes a novelist hurt. Yeah &#x2014; <br>but the hurt is so goooooooood.<br> Concision. Precision. Distill the essence or succumb to your <br>reader"s derision. Sting with story, rap with revelation, plotz with your plots.<br> You can"t languor with language. You can"t dither in discourse. <br>You can"t indulge idle idylls. You have to see, select, say.<br> The form liberates as it impinges. Crime and mystery fiction has <br>always celebrated the extraordinary more than the prosaic. Personal honor <br>and corruption. Societies divided. Murder as moral default. The Big Themes <br>of crime and mystery fiction maul mainstream minimalism and minutiae. <br>They enrapture, edify, entertain. They often orbit in orgiastic excess. They <br>muddle as murky melodrama. They occasionally log in as literature &#x2014; vibrant <br>and vulgarized.<br> The crime and mystery novel is that extraordinary world captured <br>large. The mystery short story is that world microscopically magnified.<br> A writer"s skill skirts that orbit of excess. Righteous writers <br>wrangle with murky melodrama and writhe their way out alive. Crime and <br>mystery fiction dissects and extols larger-than-life events. It"s a trap and an <br>option to fly.<br> Bad crime and mystery novels meander in murk. Their depictions <br>of large events play preposterous and make minimalism look good. Bad <br>mystery short stories are contrivances undermined by their size. They waft <br>wickedly worse as wastes of the watchmaker"s trade.<br> Yeah &#x2014; but when they"re good, you get everything.<br> Bam &#x2014; deft psychology meets a crystallized time and place. <br>Bam &#x2014; you"re someplace all new. Pop &#x2014; there"s the surface of lives in <br>stasis. Pop &#x2014; they"re not what they seem.<br> You get a mystery. It may or may not pertain to a crime. You get <br>that time and place laid out in layers. You get suspense and surprise. You <br>watch characters ascend and deep-six. Fear fillets you. Heartbreak and hurt <br>hammer home. The story is short. It may be densely packed for its size. It <br>may hinge on a simple conceit or premise. You"re wrapped up rapidemente.<br> The good short story is a reader"s sprint and a knocked-back <br>cocktail. It hits strong, it"s over quick, it induces heat and lingers when it"s <br>done. The abbreviated form makes the reader"s role more interactive. There"s <br>a crime to be solved or a mystery plumbed. There"s a revelation within rapid <br>reach. The scant page count itself creates tension. You can read short <br>stories in one sitting. You should read them that way. Whap &#x2014; you <br>circumnavigate quicksville. You get the big jolt, the instantaneous <br>assimilation. Then it"s yours to savor and mentally mess with over time.<br> Reading sprints will sap you, drain you, jazz you, move you, <br>scare you. The mystery short story will astound you with its diversity and <br>range. Many fine writers work the watchmaker"s craft in this book. Read, <br>sprint, and fall prey.<br><br>James Ellroy<br>Copyright � 2002 by Houghton Mifflin Company<br>Introduction copyright � 2002 by James Ellroy<br>Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin Company.</p><h2>Cooking with Country Music Stars</h2><p>Hardcover, as pictured (ck)</p><p></p><h2>HIDDEN NATURE</h2><p>Viktor Schauberger, 1885-1958, was a radical pioneer of the study of the subtle energies in nature and the importance of living water in all natural processes.

But this ancient body of knowledge&#x2014;the impact of lunar rhythms on our lives and our surroundings&#x2014;has become known to fewer and fewer of us, as we have migrated from agrarian to urban living. Now in Guided by the Moon, authors Johanna Paungger and Thomas Poppe recapture this wisdom, providing advice to help readers determine the timing most likely to bring them success in anything they do. Paungger and Poppe cover every area of daily life, from health, beauty, and housekeeping to nutrition, gardening, and family outings.

But this is a very natural thing, a very healthy thing.</i></p><p>Haruki Murakami, <br>Tokyo, January 2003</p><p></p><p></p><p>Foreword</p><p>All books come from somewhere. This one was swept into existence by a giant wave. For me, the catalyst for writing about Japan was the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. I had lived in Japan as a foreign correspondent from 2001 to 2008, and had often thought about writing a book back then. But the daily pressures of news reporting and my own lack of urgency ensured that the idea of a book remained just that&nbsp;&#x2013; an idea. I left Japan at the end of 2008 and went on to other things. When the earthquake struck on 11 March 2011, I flew to Japan to cover the disaster both in the immediate aftermath and over the ensuing months. The scale and horror of the catastrophe, and the way the Japanese sought to confront it, provided impetus for an idea that had lain dormant in my mind for several years. My aim was to create a portrait of a stubbornly resistant nation with a history of overcoming successive waves of adversity from would-be Mongolian invasions to repeated natural disasters. The portrait would be rooted in my own seven years&#x2019; experience of reporting and living in the country during a time of economic slowdown and loss of national confidence, but one told, as far as possible, through the voices of Japanese people themselves. It would largely be a portrait of contemporary Japan, a country that, in spite of its obvious difficulties, is changing and adapting in ways that are often invisible to the outside world. But it would also be a depiction rooted in its historical context, since events in the present are rarely fully comprehensible without reference to the past. That is certainly true of Japan, where history and tradition are ubiquitous, peeping from behind the endless concrete of what can seem one of the most relentlessly modern urban landscapes on earth.</p><p>This, then, is not a book <i>about</i> the tsunami. The scope is much broader. But the &#x2018;triple disaster&#x2019; of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown provided a starting point for an enquiry into how Japanese institutions and, just as important, Japanese people, have dealt with adversity. As the crisis unfolded, there were many failings as well as much to admire, but the tragedy reminded us of what we should not have forgotten: the extraordinary resilience of a people who live in one of the most naturally unstable regions on earth. In Hong Kong, where I now live, in the disaster&#x2019;s aftermath, many marvelled at the television images of orderly lines outside shops and in evacuation centres; they admired the quiet dignity of survivors; and they shook their heads in wonderment at the near-absence of crime. A country supposedly on its knees after two decades of stagnation had shown itself stronger than many had given it credit for. It highlighted what Pico Iyer, an author and long-time resident, called &#x2018;the self-possession and community-mindedness that are so striking in Japan; suddenly, the country that had seemed to insist on its difference from the rest of the world could be seen in its more human, compassionate and brave dimensions&#x2019;.1</p><p>The disaster revealed, too, if only for an instant, Japan&#x2019;s continuing relevance to the world. Even most Japanese were unaware that the northeast of their country, where the tsunami hit, produced anything other than rice, fish and sake. Though hardly Japan&#x2019;s industrial heartland, the northeastern Tohoku region turned out to be a vital link in the global supply chain. One factory alone produced 40 per cent of the world&#x2019;s micro-controllers, the &#x2018;little brains&#x2019; that run power steering in cars and the images on flat-screen televisions. After the tsunami destroyed the plant that makes them, halfway round the world in Louisiana, General Motors was forced to suspend vehicle production. Likewise, because of electricity shortages after the Fukushima nuclear crisis, Japan&nbsp;&#x2013; already the world&#x2019;s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas&nbsp;&#x2013; stepped up its purchases of LNG, oil and subsequently coal, becoming an important swing factor in global energy demand.</p><p>What the Japanese call &#x2018;Japan bashing&#x2019; stems partly from the country&#x2019;s continued importance to the global economy. No one bothers much to bash Switzerland, which also grew at approximately 1 per cent a year in the 1990s, thus suffering, by the Japanese yardstick, its own &#x2018;lost decade&#x2019;. But Switzerland, though an important financial centre, is a smallish economy. Japan has shrunk in relative terms, but still accounts for 8 per cent of global output against 3.4 per cent for Britain and 20 per cent for the US. Japan is the world&#x2019;s biggest creditor nation, not its biggest debtor as is sometimes supposed. It has the second highest foreign exchange reserves and by 2012 was again vying with China to be the biggest holder of US debt. The tsunami briefly reminded people of these neglected facts. It was ironic that, just when Japan was truly in the midst of crisis, some people should be reminded of how important it still was.</p><p>Of course, the crisis also revealed much weakness. Many argued that the tsunami, which destroyed factories, roads and other infrastructure worth an astonishing 10 per cent of GDP, would be the final nail in Japan&#x2019;s economic coffin. If nothing else, it would accelerate what was already the slow exodus of manufacturing to China and other cheaper production bases. Even worse than Japan&#x2019;s economic vulnerability was evidence of a rotten body politic. The crisis at Fukushima exposed an official culture riddled with paternalism, complacency and deceit. The risks of a nuclear catastrophe in the most seismically unstable country on earth ought to have been foreseeable, as should the vulnerability of plants so close to a tsunami-prone coastline. Bureaucrats, politicians and nuclear plant operators were blinded by their faith in Japanese technology and organization. In other ways too, the Japanese state was shown to be unprepared. Some old people&#x2019;s homes had inadequate, or non-existent, evacuation procedures. After the disaster, it took too long for the central government to identify needs on the ground and to meet them with financial and technical help. Too much was left to the legendary diehard patience of the people of northeast Japan themselves. Japan&#x2019;s response may have been far better than that of the US in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, but it left much to be desired.</p><p>Still, great moments of crisis have proved decisive turning points in Japanese history before. Some hoped the country, literally jolted from its complacency, would rediscover its lost energy. John Dower, whose book <i>Embracing Defeat</i> is perhaps the greatest study by a foreign scholar of post-war Japan, talked of the clarity that can come from such moments. &#x2018;Things are cracked open and things can be put in motion,&#x2019; he told me not long after the tsunami. The tragedy, he said, had provided a fresh opportunity for ordinary Japanese&nbsp;&#x2013; not just its politicians and bureaucrats&nbsp;&#x2013; to rethink priorities and to remake their society. &#x2018;The question is can they do it again?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Will these ideas be squelched because of the entrenched, gridlocked system? Or can this help create a more participatory democracy, can people be mobilized as they have on occasions in the past, and challenge what is going on?&#x2019;2</p><p>The title of this book, <i>Bending Adversity</i>, comes from a Japanese proverb about transforming bad fortune into good. Japan has a remarkable track record of confronting and transcending adversity. Virtually alone in Asia, it resisted the colonial predations of western powers. After 1945, it overcame its own crushing defeat by blazing an economic trail that has had a profound impact on all of Asia, including China. In both instances, it found some sort of path through adversity. Sometimes, though, rather than bending adversity to its own advantage, Japan has instead been bent by circumstance. Its island status has provided it security and a firm sense of itself, yet too often it has been a prisoner of its geography and an island mentality. Its nineteenth-century struggle to ward off colonial intent ended up in an imperial endeavour of its own that caused the death of millions and its own near-annihilation. If this was bending adversity, it had perhaps been better left unbent. Even its post-war economic miracle, so impressive in so many ways, could seem to some like a soulless exercise in wealth accumulation, a search for international prestige through manufacturing and commerce where war and conquest had failed. Though Japan had found the key to economic development, it had perhaps lost something of itself in the process.</p><p>Now it has lost its economic vigour too. Paradoxically, as Haruki Murakami, the best-selling author, once suggested to me, this may give it a better chance of finding itself again. Along with post-bubble drift has come an existential angst, a probing for a way forward. Japan was lost, he said, but to be lost is not always a bad thing. A friend, echoing those sentiments, recently wrote to me of her fellow Japanese, &#x2018;People are lost. They lost their model and they lost themselves.&#x2019; But in the disappearance of something old lies the possibility of something new&nbsp;&#x2013; at least a chance to bend adversity and turn it into something better.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I arrived in Japan in the winter of 2001. Before I started my job as a foreign correspondent in Tokyo, I spent a month beginning to learn the language while I was living with a family in the castle town of Kanazawa, a sort of mini-Kyoto on the rugged Sea of Japan coast. Kanazawa was a charming place with much of its medieval heritage preserved. It had samurai and geisha quarters, a famous garden called Kenroku-en&nbsp;&#x2013; like most famous sights in Japan, diplomatically said to be one of the &#x2018;best three&#x2019; in the country&nbsp;&#x2013; and a thriving artistic community of potters, gold-leaf craftsmen and amateur Noh dramatists. On my first day, fresh off the plane from London, I was taken to the sixteenth-century moated castle, an imposing whitewashed structure set on huge stone walls, to attend a tea ceremony. Dozens of people had gathered on a gazebo-like platform in the castle grounds, where the ritual was to take place. I was ushered by my &#x2018;host mother&#x2019;, Mrs Nishida, to the very front so that I could sit as close as possible to the proceedings. A woman in kimono prepared the hot water in a sunken hearth, spooning out green powder with a wooden scoop and whisking it with a long brush. Every action she performed, from the way she knelt to her handling of the tea bowl, was precise and rehearsed&nbsp;&#x2013; a mirror of the actions made in countless other tea ceremonies down the ages. I sat, as did everyone else, in <i>seiza</i> style, legs and feet folded beneath my buttocks, back straight. After a few minutes of initial pain, my limbs grew used to the position and I concentrated on what was going on around me. When the tea was served, we first ate an exquisite handmade sweet, separating it into bite-sized pieces with a small wooden utensil like a large toothpick. Then we earnestly examined the tea bowl&#x2019;s shape and glaze, and felt the heat of the tea penetrate the fired clay. We rotated the bowl two quarter-turns, before downing the pleasantly bitter, jade-green liquid in quick, noisy slurps.</p><p>Japan is a country of performances and role-playing: here we were all actors in a centuries-old pageant, our every action dictated by custom. When the ceremony was over, the other guests rose and took their leave. My lower limbs, however, had lost all feeling and standing was impossible. I was left, alone on the stage, waiting for what seemed like several minutes while a painful tingle slowly crept up my legs as sensation returned. I still regard the experience as my initiation into the pains and pleasures of Japan.</p><p>From my first days in Kanazawa, I resolved to embrace the new culture in which I found myself. I ate the food I was served, whether it was crab brains, sea urchin or raw octopus. Slowly I discovered that almost everything the Japanese prepared, however unfamiliar, was fresh and delicious&nbsp;&#x2013; better, in fact, than any food I had tasted before. At the age of thirty-seven, I plunged into the study of the Japanese language, working my way through a series of exams that obliged me to learn more than 2,000 <i>kanji</i> characters and obscure grammatical constructions. (I eventually learned to read fairly fluently and to conduct stilted interviews, but my Japanese remained like Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s description of a dog walking on its hind legs: it was not done well, though at my age it was perhaps surprising to find it done at all.) In Kanazawa, I learned to love the routine of living on tatami, the traditional rush-mat flooring. One removed one&#x2019;s shoes at the house entrance known as the <i>genkan</i>, knelt on the floor to watch TV and unrolled one&#x2019;s futon at night. The tatami had a comforting, musky smell. Bathing was in a square upright tub, in which you sat only after a thorough scrub in a separate shower area. Sometimes we would walk to the local public bath with its old-fashioned municipal tiles. It had outdoor communal pools of cold, warm and hot sulfurous water and vibrating massage chairs of worn leather in the changing room.</p><p>I loved that Japanese people always put their hands together to thank their food before they ate it, and the way they apologized before they asked for money in a shop as though payment sullied the otherwise pleasant human interaction. I learned the correct place at which guests should sit at a table&nbsp;&#x2013; furthest from the door, a position in former times that was safest from surprise attack. I gained an appreciation for small, considerate gestures. My teacher had told me, for example, that it was rude in a business conversation to say that you were busy, since this might imply that you were more in demand than the person to whom you were speaking. I liked it that even cheap restaurants handed out a hot hand towel before you ate and that, when it rained, there was a machine at the department store to seal your wet umbrella in a plastic cover. I marvelled at how social convention trumped laws. The streets were entirely litter-free. No one would dream of answering their mobile phone on the train or in a lift, not because it was illegal but because consideration was expected. Even in the street, people cupped their hands over mouth and phone to muffle the sound of their voice.</p><p>When I got to Tokyo to start my job, I was enthralled all over again. Its urban thrum, theatres and galleries and astonishing variety of restaurants, clubs and bars made it the New York of Asia, only far bigger, with a population, in the greater metropolis, of 36 million people. Yet Tokyo was anything but the faceless conurbation I had imagined. Most big cities have been described as a collection of villages. But Tokyo, more than any other, deserves that description. City neighbourhoods, including the one I moved to in Higashi Kitazawa, are still organized into village-sized units. At festival times, bankers to bricklayers gather to pound rice into soft <i>mochi</i> cakes.

Henry seeks a spirited, lusty new wife--and eyes the beautiful Nyssa. But in a land rife with conspiracy and rebellion, there are those in secret power determined to thwart Henry's intentions. A drugged Nyssa awakens in the arms of the notorious rake Varian de Winter. Her virtue destroyed, the outraged king orders them to wed.<br>Handsome--and soon smitten--Varian de Winter dares to conquer his spitfire bride. But the intrigues and dark side of the court intrude upon their brief happiness as Nyssa is trapped in a devious plot and witness to the deadly wrath of Henry Tudor. Suddenly, jealousy and revenge grow bloodthirsty, and all that Nyssa holds dear is in dire <br>jeopardy. . . .</p><p>Small's latest that picks up where Blaze Wyndham (1988) left off. The court of Henry VIII offers an unending supply of plot and counterplot to fill the interludes between heavy breathing. When this installment begins, Blaze uses her past intimacy with Henry to secure for her eldest daughter, Nyssa, a position as maiden to the newly betrothed Princess of Cleves. But no one pretends that Nyssa goes merely to serve the queen: ``Once you find a husband, you will marry and live happily ever after. That is the whole purpose of your coming to court.'' When Henry seeks an annulment because he finds his new wife too unappetizing to mount, he turns his lascivious attention to Nyssa and the equally beautiful, but witless, Catherine Howard. Catherine's uncle recognizes the power he'll gain if his niece becomes the next queen of England, so he drugs Nyssa and plops her in his grandson Varian's bed for Henry to discover. Varian doesn't get too upset when Henry orders them to marry immediately. After all, he's been in love with Nyssa from first sight, but he didn't have a chance because years earlier he had been accused (falsely) of a rape. At the same time, Nyssa, who thought she'd marry for love, quickly discovers that lust is almost as good a reason. All is threatened within a year when Catherine takes a lover; Nyssa must think fast to save her husband, for the king seeks to punish every Howard he can find. Heavy on historical detail and unusually light on romantic hobnobbing. Still, Small's faithful can't help but follow along. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Mrs. Savage has been left ten million dollars by her husband and wants to make the best use of it, in spite of the efforts of her grown-up stepchildren to get their hands on it. These latter, knowing that the widow&#39;s wealth is now in negotiable securities, and seeing they cannot get hold of it, commit her to a &#34;sanatorium&#34; hoping to &#34;bring her to her senses.&#34; But Mrs. Savage is determined to establish a fund to help others realize their hopes and dreams. In the sanatorium she meets various social misfits, men and women who just cannot adjust themselves to life, people who need the help Mrs. Savage can provide. In getting to know them, she realizes that she will find happiness with them and plans to spend the rest of her life as one of them. But when the doctor tells her there is no reason why she should remain, she hesitates to go out into a hard world where people seem ready to do anything for money. The self-seeking stepchildren are driven to distraction by their vain efforts to browbeat Mrs. Savage, but she preserves her equanimity and leads them on a merry chase. At last her friends conspire to get rid of her stepchildren, and through their simple belief in the justice of her cause, they enable Mrs. Savage to carry out her plans. The last scene, a farewell party, is a delightful fantasy where each &#34;guest&#34; in the sanatorium realizes at last some hopeless dream for something he was never able to realize. The dominant mood is high comedy, and the audience is left with a feeling that the neglected virtues of kindness and affection have not been entirely lost in a world that seems motivated at times only by greed and dishonesty.</p><p></p><h2>Lotte Jacobi</h2><p>Hardback book with dust jacket titled LOTTE JACOBI.

His paintings and drawings came directly from his own experiences; he was a Civil War hero whose earliest recorded actions include the saving of nine soldiers and the capture of a Confederate officer, for which he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He also took part in the Indian census of 1890 and witnessed firsthand the demise of the old, Native American, West. This first-ever biography of Scott focuses on how his experiences were reflected in his art, from the oil paintings of Civil War soldiers in the field to pencil sketches of Native Americans. There are almost 100 reproductions, some in color.</p><p>"this admirably researched book, the first full-length study of the artist, is a valiant and serious attempt to lift the artist out of obscurity" -- <i><i>Civil War History</i></i><br><br>"this detailed and perceptive biography is the first sustained examination of Scott's life...illuminates details of the career of this intriguing individual" -- <i><i>Choice</i></i><br><br>"thorough research...is a good look at a productive but ultimately sad life" -- <i><i>Military Images</i></i></p><h2>The General of the Dead Army</h2><p>This is the story of an Italian general, accompanied by his chaplain, charged with the mission of scouring Albania in search of the bones of their fallen countrymen, killed twenty years earlier during World War II.</p><p><i>The General of the Dead Army</i>, Ismail Kadare's meditation on the consequences of war, is a hugely moving account of duty and loss. It is 20 years since the end of World War II and an Italian army general is sent to Albania to search again for the bodies of those who lost their lives in the campaign. He is armed with maps, lists, measurements, and dental and other records. He tours the countryside organizing digs and disinterments and, as he tries to find the dead sons of forgotten families, he wonders at the sense, and scale, of his task. He talks and argues with the curt Italian priest who is accompanying him. He finds his footsteps followed, sometimes anticipated, by a fellow general who is also looking for bodies--the bodies of his German countrymen. He struggles with the Albanian countryside, weather, laborers who work for him, and peasants who watch their work. And he fights the despair that grows as the size, scope, and, ultimately, the hopelessness of his task becomes ever more apparent.<p> Kadare's plaintive novel is a consistently heartfelt lament to all those who have died and been affected by war, but it is also a beautiful work displaying the skills that make him one of the great modern European writers. <i>--Mark Thwaite, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Ismail Kadare, born in 1936 in the Albanian mountain town of Gjirokaster near the Greek border, is Albania&#x2019;s best-known poet and novelist.

He who knows it not, knows not the heights and depths of the soul; he misses the trials and tragedy and the beauty and grandeur of life. More details: The Mahabharata is not a mere epic; it is a romance, telling the tale of heroic men and women, and of some who were divine; it is a whole literature in itself, containing a code of life, a philosophy of social and ethical relations, and speculative thought on human problems that is hard to rival; but, above all, it has for its core the Gita,which is, as the world is beginning to find out, the noblest of scriptures and the grandest of sagas in which the climax is reached in the wondrous apocalypse in the Eleventh Canto.

Ron Hansen lives in northern California, where he teaches at Santa Clara University. </p>Ron Hansen�s novel chronicles the lives and times of Jesse James and Robert Ford, the sycophantic young outlaw who eventually shot Jesse in the back. In Hansen�s quest for period accuracy, the early chapters are slow going, but G. Valmont Thomas�s narration is strong enough to overcome the heavy exposition. Thomas�s shaded characterizations provide fascinating human insights into the legend of Jesse. The author reveals details of the gunslinger�s personality--he used potions, and was superstitious and vain. Jesse�s relationship with Zee is described as well--from courtship to marriage. Hansen�s habit of �verbing� nouns gets annoying (�wristed with lace,� �snailed across the road�), but Thomas�s performance is so appealing--with his mellifluous tones; honest, uncluttered delivery; and perfect diction--that listeners won�t mind. Thomas makes this an audiobook you won�t want to miss.

Her past titles include Saint George and the Dragon, The True Tale of Johnny Appleseed, and Up the Chimney. Her most recent title, Merlin and the Making of the King, received many starred reviews.Grade 3 Up-- While this tale is retold in most adaptations of Arthurian legend, it is not readily available in a single, lavishly illustrated version such as this one. The story is of Gareth of Orkney, Gawaine's brother, who hides his identity to serve a year as a kitchen boy in King Arthur's court, and his quest to the Perilous Gard in the company of Linette, who also hides her identity and reviles him throughout their journey to rescue her sister, Linesse. He falls in love at first distant sight of Linesse, who checks him out by kidnapping his dwarf, but decides he's worthy and agrees to marry him. There is a lot more to the story, of course, and Hodges gets in all the essentials that Malory included, leaving out some unexplained characters and repetitive battles. She also leaves out Gareth's comment that he doesn't listen to women, anyway. Just as well, even though it's a comment appropriate to its time, and quite telling about chivalry. Linesse's testing of a man who saved her life may be understood to be wise in a time when women were kidnapped and treated as property. The loose ends tend to be Malory's own. This does not tell in quite the straight line of Gawaine's adventure with the loathly damsel, told also by Chaucer's Wife of Bath. Hyman's richly romantic illustrations are lush watercolors, framed and broken with framed insets for closeups and framed text inside the panoramic picture. The format is horizontal, capturing the sweep of the story. While not a tale of King Arthur, it's a wonderful taste of Arthurian legend, hopefully whetting young appetites for more. --Helen Gregory, Grosse Pointe Public Library, MI<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: Ancient Greece</h2><p>Now in Paperback! <p>Watch the past come to life in <i>Eyewitness: Ancient Greece</i>.

UK edition of Penguin Twentieth Century Classics.</p><p>Like <i>Lolita</i>, Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Pale Fire</i> is a masterpiece that imprisons us inside the mazelike head of a mad �migr�. Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>Driving Your Own Karma: Swami Beyondananda&#39;s Tour Guide to Enlightenment</h2><p>Have you tried so many spiritual paths that you&#39;ve become pathological?

Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>STR SHT &amp; PICNIC PLOT</h2><p>The Purple Pieman almost sabotages the Strawberryland picnic--but not quite.

And that includes the crucial zone below the belt, both fore and aft. There was nothing ambiguous about Tom of Finland's interest in his objects of desire: ""lf I don't have an erection when I'm doing a drawing, I know it's no good"", he himself said. The eroti-cism is naked, even aggressive. The poses inevitably consigned his work to the pornography shelves, and the walls of leather bars in the gay scene. So far there has been no account of the artistic virtuosity of his work.<p>The present volume traces the life and career of this important artist. Born in southern Finland, Tom played the piano at local coffee shops to supplement his income as a graphic artist until his watercolors of male sexuality began to appear as covers on major American gay publications. His impact as an artist has since stretched far beyond the gay scene.</p></p><p>Text: English, French, German</p><h2>American Alphabets: 25 Contemporary Poets (FIELD Editions)</h2><p>A major new anthology of recent American poetry, featuring generous selections of the work of 25 extraordinary poets born since World War II, with thoughtful introductions and annotations.

As in the better of the James Bond genre, this is not so much about plot and spying or any relation to a real world situation as it is about the 007 persona and how James is able to extract himself from impossible situations using his quick wits, athleticism, good looks, and general "coolness." The plot involves an unscrupulous media mogul, all the remaining national superpowers and pretenders, various male and female intelligence operatives who apparently are immune to AIDS or have learned to refrain from rational thought, and the expected military and mercenary contingents. Lots of action, sex, and violence here, but tastefully done with the good separated from the evil. A treat for Bond fans from teen to adult.

Combining the research of economic historians with the insights provided by recent advances in social and cultural history, Keith Wrightson describes the basic institutions and relationships of economic life, traces the processes of change, and examines how these changes affected men, women, and children at all social levels.<br><br>Wrightson reemphasizes the significance of the period as a turning point in British economic development, one that included the creation of an integrated market economy, the expansion of capitalist organization and enterprise, and reconfigurations of economic power. He shows how economic practices and priorities were embedded in social relations and how shifts in attitudes, values, and understandings played an essential part in the emergence of a market society. And he compares and contrasts the distinctive experiences of Scotland and Wales with those of England. Novel in its structure, scope, and emphasis on the lived experience of the period, the book vividly demonstrates the gains and costs of economic change.</p><p>The New Economic History of Britain Series"This is a wonderful book; profoundly learned, brilliantly conceptualized, confidently and clearly and vividly written. It is truly a distinguished piece of work."&#x2014;John Morrill, Cambridge University "This . . . is a splendid book, beautifully organized, mellifluously written, and powerfully evocative of the birthpangs of market culture. It convincingly shows why economic history matters; why the time is right for a new synthesis; and why there has been such long-standing concern with the early modern period as a time of change. "&#x2014;Steve Hindle, Rural History "Wrightson's innovativeness lies in interweaving social and economic literatures into a coherent whole and in covering Wales and Scotland.

Decadent socialites packing Lugars. Cotillions. With towns like Savannah, Georgia, who needs Fellini? <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i> takes two narrative strands--each worthy of its own book--and weaves them together to make a single fascinating tale. The first is author John Berendt's loving depiction of the characters and rascals that prowled Savannah in the eight years it was his home-away-from-home. "Eccentrics thrive in Savannah," he writes, and proves the point by introducing Luther Diggers, a thwarted inventor who just might be plotting to poison the town's water supply; Joe Odom, a jovial jackleg lawyer and squatter nonpareil; and, most memorably, the Lady Chablis, whom you really should meet for yourself. Then, on May 2, 1981, the book's second story line commences, when Jim Williams, a wealthy antique dealer and Savannah's host with the most, kills his "friend" Danny Hansford. (If those quotes make you suspect something, you should.) Was it self-defense, as Williams claimed--or murder? The book sketches four separate trials, during which the dark side of this genteel party town is well and truly plumbed.Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case. <p><br>It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the "soul of pampered self-absorption"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else. </p><p><br> Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story is a sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city is certain to become a modern classic. </p><p>"From theHardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Slapstick Or Lonesome No More!</h2><p>Wilbur Swain and his twin sister, Eliza, are so immensely hideous, helpless and vile in their infancy that their wealthy parents are forced to send them to live on a nearby asteroid. But behind their facade of idiocy, the monstrous pair possess a joint intelligence that could outstrip the most advanced computers...</p><p>Dr. Wilbur Daffodil-11 Swain, centenarian, the last President of the United States, King of Manhattan, and one-half (along with his sister, Eliza) of the most powerful intelligence since Einstein, is penning his autobiography. He occupies the first floor of a ruined Empire State Building and lives like a royal scavenger with his illiterate granddaughter and her beau. Buffeted by fluctuating gravity, the U.S. has been scourged by not one, but two lethal diseases: the Green Death and the Albanian Flu. Consequently, the country has fallen into civil war. (Super-intelligent, miniaturized Chinese watch the West self-destruct from the sidelines.) Swain stayed at the White House until there were no citizens left to govern, then moved to deserted New York City, where he writes a thoughtful missive before death. <p> In <i>Slapstick</i>, Vonnegut muses on war, man's hubris, and the awful, crippling loneliness humans are freighted with--but, miraculously, the book still manages to delight and amuse. Absurd, knowing, never depressing, <i>Slapstick</i> kindles hope--for the possibility of wisdom, perhaps; for human resiliency, surely. </p><p> It's best to end with a quote from the prologue wherein the author discourses on The Meaning of It All, or at least This Book: "Love is where you find it. I think it is foolish to go off looking for it, and I think it can often be poisonous. <br> I wish that people who are conventionally supposed to love each other would say to each other, when they fight, 'Please--a little less love, and a little more common decency.'" <br> Amen.</p>Slapstick presents an apocalyptic vision seen through the eyes of the current King of Manhattan (and last President of the United States), a wickedly irreverent look at the all-too-possible results of today's follies. But even the end of life-as-we-know-it is transformed by Vonnegut's pen into hilarious farce--a final slapstick that may be the Almighty's joke on us all.<p></p><p>"Vonnegut's ongoing puppet show. . .the fabulous is reborn."--John Updike, <i>The New Yorker.</i></p><p></p><p> "Imaginative and hilarious... a brilliant vision of wrecked, wacked-out future!" --<i>Hartford Courant</i></p></p><h2>Realityland: True-Life Adventures at Walt Disney World</h2><p>The first in-depth, unauthorized look at the creation and operation of the world&#39;s most popular vacation destination. The author of the best-selling Mouse Tales: A Behind-the-Ears Look at Disneyland reveals how Walt Disney&#39;s City of Tomorrow evolved into a sprawling resort where--despite extraordinary efforts to control every aspect of &#34;the show&#34;--everything doesn&#39;t always go according to script.</p><p>Walt Disney constantly pushed his animators and theme park designers to make their creations look as &#x201c;realistic&#x201d; as possible. Yet his was always a romanticized reality. His &#x201c;Disney versions&#x201d; scrubbed clean the Grimm Brothers&#x2019; morbid fairy tales. His &#x201c;True-Life Adventure&#x201d; nature films humanized animals and invented not-always-true storylines. Walt was concerned not with the way things were, but with the way things should be.In Florida, he wanted to create a hyper-idealistic theme park, but as just one small component of an entire city built on those same principles&#x2014;an &#x201c;Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.&#x201d; "Realityland: True-Life Adventures at Walt Disney World" by David Koenig follows Walt and his hand-picked successors as they first surreptitiously acquire enough land to hold his ambitious dreams, then go about trying to make them come true&#x2014;all the while battling thieving contractors, unlike-minded executives, unscrupulous corporate raiders, uncontrollable economic forces, and public-relations nightmares. Based on a decade of research and interviews with 100 Disney insiders, "Realityland" also reveals what it&#x2019;s like to work for The Mouse, what lies in the Magic Kingdom&#x2019;s subterranean tunnels, and how&#x2014;despite extraordinary efforts to control every aspect of &#x201c;the show&#x201d;&#x2014;everything doesn&#x2019;t always go according to plan.Hundreds of never-before-published tales and two dozen photographs add to the inside story of the world&#x2019;s most popular and unique Vacation Kingdom.David Koenig is chief editor for trade magazine conglomerate Cutler Publishing.

Arnold somehow manages to explain the significance of many of the New Deal&#39;s alphabet soup agencies while focusing his story on the main players&#39; characters and motivations. Rexford Tugwell&#39;s insouciant megalomania are perfectly on display here, as is a nation&#39;s fascinated horror about his (the RA&#39;s), &#34;Soviet Communes in America.&#34; FDR&#39;s interest in the program is traced back to his city planning uncle Frederick Delano, who would wax philosophic to a young FDR on the need for comprehensive regional plans. Even Dean Acheson makes an improbable appearance here as a land syndicate lawyer suing to stop a public housing program in the New Jersey countryside. But as is appropriate with a story about a social experiment, Arnold also examines the effects of the experiment on the test subjects. He finds that the early inhabitants of these new towns founded a variety of institutions that spontaneously mirrored many the New Dealers were trying to form from on high. There were credit and shopping cooperatives, non-profit hospitals, community newspapers. Most failed quickly, but a few survive to this day (Greenbelts co-op grocery is still there, check it out).&#34; by Frank Stein</p><p></p><h2>Best in Show: 25 More Dogs to Knit</h2><p>The leading knitting books of 2010 and 2011, Best in Show Dogs &amp; Cats have been outstanding global successes.

The binding illustration is&nbsp;by Kazuko Nomoto, whose clients include <i>New York&nbsp;Times</i> and the<i> Gap</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

The strategy has been hugely popular, allowing expansion to five outlets, including tapas, take- aways and a Mother India Cafe in Edinburgh. Mother India is regularly ranked in Herald restaurant critic Ron MacKenna&#x2019;s top 10 Scottish restaurants. The book will incorporate a first person account of Monir&#x2019;s personal culinary journey, with a photo essay of the life of one of the world's great Indian restaurants as an integral cog in the cultural melting pot of a modern British city. Alongside this will be a collection of recipes, some of which are signature Mother India dishes, and others designed specifically for home cooking. Each recipe will draw upon Monir's story: his beginnings as a boy from a British Asian family who started working in restaurants at 14 and his pivotal stay in the Punjab in his late teens where he learned the ancient principles of Indian home cooking from scratch. The book will tell the story of the risks he took to build a personal, authentic style of Indian cooking. There are human stories running through the recipes as well: Hajra Bibi's Salmon was inspired by a dish his mother (Hajra Bibi) used to make them as children.</p><p>When it comes to awards <b>Monir Mohammed</b>, chef-patron of the Mother India and Wee Curry Shop group of restaurants, has almost as many accolades as he has recipes.

But when his path crosses that of Sergeant Randall Blackburn, who is in pursuit of the killer, the two become an investigative team that will use both a youth&#x2019;s intuitive gifts and a policeman&#x2019;s new deductive techniques and crime-fighting tools to unmask a vicious murderer whose fury can be as intense as that of Mother Nature herself.<br>&#x201c;Every historical mystery tries to hone in on the ideal setting at the perfect moment in time.

The London physician was called in to examine the body of Mary Kelly, one of Jack the Ripper&#x2019;s more savagely disposed victims. Initially, Dr.&nbsp;Bond was only asked to determine whether or not the victim&#x2019;s remains indicated that the perpetrator had any surgical skill, but the doctor was so horrified by the intensity of the crime that he stayed on to reconstruct the event and develop a speculative description of the killer. <br>This approach was so unprecedented that there was not even a name for this new system of thinking about the relationship between an individual personality and a specific crime. However, in spite of the apparent novelty, the insights that Dr. Bond employed are all, at their essence, part and parcel of the timeless human capacity for wisdom. The same quest drives the appreciation for the psychological aspects of crime fiction. Avid readers of crime fiction have eyes honed for the vagaries of human personality.<br>Dr. Bond based his work upon (a) inferences taken from the crime scene; (b) the condition of the victim&#x2019;s body; and (c) the random nature of the crime. History tells us that Bond&#x2019;s work did nothing to reveal the identity of The Ripper. Nevertheless, in terms of engendering a whole new way of thinking about the psychology of crime, it was and still is a wellspring that serves anyone who searches for greater understanding of human behavior by accumulating insights into its most deviant forms.<br>Since the methodology of profiling is one that guides an investigator to a deeper and more three-dimensional view of an unknown subject, those same tools are equally effective in deepening the way in which crime fiction is written. This is part of what makes it so appealing to contemporary readers.<br>The more commonly known aspects of the field of criminal profiling have entered the Western world&#x2019;s zeitgeist to the extent that the general public now possesses a language for delving more deeply into motive and into personal point of view in the telling of a story than it has at any time in our past. Today, a well-considered characterization of a criminal profiler will show a flawed individual with feet of clay, perhaps in many ways little different from the quarry.<br>Perhaps largely due to the effects of TV and film, most people today realize that the reputation for &#x201c;dark arts&#x201d; being behind the methodology of modern profilers is simply the result of the startled amazement that often greets a good profiler&#x2019;s conclusions. The prosaic reality is that the professional profiler merely employs a system of thought created to help investigators think unthinkable things while they do intolerable work, and yet remain focused on their goals and their job functions. The patterns that a profiler is trained to study are the result of thousands of bits of information accumulated over generations of law enforcement experience regarding how criminal behavior tends to work.<br>The skilled profiler questions how the given criminal behavior (as indicated by the crime scene) <i>served </i>the perpetrator during the commission of the crime. Just as important, the profiler asks how such needs in the perpetrator may have been caused in the first place. Writers of crime fiction have learned to answer these questions also, because modern readers of crime fiction are far more sophisticated about criminal psychology.<br>Unfortunately, at the same time that public awareness of the profiling field has grown, the use of the word &#x201c;profiling&#x201d; in the media has sometimes taken on a churlish political tone. It&#x2019;s not difficult to see why. Today, that word has been distorted until it covers a range of meanings. <br>It might refer to the specific field of behavioral analysis taught at the FBI academy, or instead to the use of overbroad physical descriptions for targeting a certain group, or it might even describe the sparking point for spontaneous outbursts of stranger-on-stranger violence. Whether or not these uses of the word are accurate in any given example, as an aggregate they have imparted a politically incorrect aroma to the word profiling that the core concept does not deserve. The fact that certain people or media organizations misuse any term or topic does not diminish its value in more earnest and capable hands.<br>So let&#x2019;s assume that today, those capable hands belong to you, reader. Let&#x2019;s hunt for the meaning of the idea of &#x201c;profiling&#x201d; as it applies to you and to me, regardless of what the folks at Quantico are teaching their recruits. And why not? You are a reader of mysteries, ready to pursue the answer to a puzzle through a menagerie of dark fantasies, are you not? Thus you may be &#x201c;profiled&#x201d; enough to deduce that you employ a number of skills in your reading and in your daily life that you would also be employing if you were to profile someone in the most educated use of the term. <br>Scientific profiling simply provides an experimentally verified structure for utilizing natural insights into human behavior. You, reader of mystery fiction, a born profiler, may have figured that out already.<br>The old-school name for it was &#x201c;learning to be a solid judge of character,&#x201d; or words to that effect. But the skill set starts about as far down the mammalian chain as you care to go. You can pick any single example among all the conscious creatures and still be assured that if that creature gets rudely slapped in the side of the head every time it turns to the right, it will eventually adopt a movement pattern that consists primarily of left-hand turns. <br>It is self-evident that all living things must be <i>expected </i>to choose behaviors that increase their chances of survival, which they will understand to be those things that help them avoid pain. Pain itself is our most powerful message of <i>Don&#x2019;t Do That.<br></i>So let&#x2019;s not. Instead, let us assume that there is a constructive purpose to be made of the million little slaps to the head that events and people give us, every day of our lives, and try turning to the left for a while, just to see if anything improves. Profiling, then, is the logical extension of that fundamental survival behavior. While the insights provided by good crime profiling are impressive, the results that those same insights can offer to our personal lives are desirable and real.<br>The very process of living among others of our civilization will guarantee the constant abrasion of cross-purposes and misunderstandings, but we define our social selves by how we deal with such things. At the same time, those daily conflicts teach us countless mini-lessons about others that we file away, without even thinking about it. They become part of the individual database that we each possess&#x2013;our private shorthand for making quick decisions under pressure. In the making of those decisions, the countless little flashes of memory work together, with the goal of refining our ability to handle passing challenges with a minimum of pain or danger.<br>That is why, although we must acknowledge that any given group of four or five large and rowdy young men lounging against the corner of an alley are <i>not necessarily </i>drunk and dangerous, no reasonable person would condemn another individual for crossing the street to pass. If the men really are just a few guys hanging out on a corner and not a threat, then they won&#x2019;t take offense just because someone quietly avoids them. They will realize that the stranger is simply being cautious. <br>Therefore, those who do cross to the other side and safely pass by can legitimately congratulate themselves; they may not have formed a criminal profile <i>per se, </i>but their natural profiling abilities may well have saved them from an unpleasant, dangerous, or lethal experience.<br>The problem with profiling, then, is (1) it works; and (2) it is too easy for the general ideas of profiling to be &#x201c;borrowed,&#x201d; without having to also acquire the knowledge and skill to properly and fairly apply the principles to the work. We think of young black male defendants insisting that they were pulled over by the police on a charge of nothing more than Driving While Black, or Hispanic citizens caught up in a sweep of illegal immigrants.<br>In such cases, we know that it is reasonable to at least consider the possibility of bigotry, otherwise such accusations would fade into the same background static produced at any courthouse full of defendants. Whether or not the arrests had anything to do with bigotry or deliberate persecution, when suspects are incarcerated due to errant attempts at profiling, many emerge from the experience deeply shaken and permanently outraged.<br>Nothing changes the fact that in the wrong hands, stereotyping that is inaccurately <i>called </i>profiling can be used as a tool of bigotry, and that any tool can be turned into a weapon. The fact that the profiler&#x2019;s tools are powerful should only assure that they are handled with care. There is too much of value there, to avoid it. <br>In our daily lives, profiling skills allow us to extend our universal right to avoid pain or danger by employing our experiences to help predict future actions. <i>A million tiny slaps to the head</i>&#x2013;each one a single bit of the data used to sort out the angels from the demons, the talkers from the doers, the safety from the danger.<br>The commonsense elements of wisdom, old as civilization, are plain to see in the standardized thinking of professional criminal profilers. Consider the fundamental concept behind modern profiling in the United States, today: the categories of Organized versus Disorganized crimes. <br>These terms can pertain to the crime scene itself as well as to the perpetrator(s), and the FBI teaches this fundamental division of crimes and crime scenes to its trainees. Under this system of observation and conclusion, our unknown perpetrator or perpetrators immediately give away a great deal about themselves, simply by leaving the crime scene in a state that must inevitably fall into one category or the other. The result is a delineation that not only works for crime investigation, but one that is the logical extension of insights that ordinary people have used for centuries to spot potential trouble with others.<br><br><b>THE DISORGANIZED CRIMINAL<br></b><br>When these emotionally driven types go through a crime scene in a frenzy, they reveal a lack of self-control that is fundamental to who they are. These killers will be careless about potential evidence while they are lost in the act of the crime, while the sensations of the moment overwhelm any concern for consequence.<br>That trait will also extend throughout their lives. Once captured, this person&#x2019;s physical and social life will undoubtedly reflect an inability to sustain normal habits and a sociable disposition. These perpetrators are generally shown to be persons of lesser intellect, or those whose lives are not dominated by the use of their mind. They can seldom provide a credible character witness who will speak up for them.<br>Disorganized killers tend to live in a personal state that makes them compar...</p><p><b>Anthony Flacco</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Hidden Man</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Last Nightingale</i>, and two nonfiction books:&nbsp;<i>A Checklist for Murder</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Tiny Dancer</i>.

At thirty-two years of age, he was able to power his long legs up the steep terrain with such speed that he could leave his beat at five in the morning, traverse more than a dozen blocks uphill, plus a few short connecting streets, and still be at his desk with enough time to jot down a brief nightly report and quit the shift by six. The strenuous hiking routine usually helped to calm him down after a long night. This morning, it barely had any effect. He was coming off of an unusually rough beat patrolling the &#x201c;Barbary Coast&#x201d; district, whose grand name was a fa�ade for a strip of bottom-feeder saloons and dead-end flophouses down near the waterfront. The whole night had been filled with more violent rampage and general disturbance than he had ever seen on a&nbsp; single shift. He spent most of his shift dodging punches from drunken gamblers and avoiding knife blades flashed by syphilitic whores. Their mania was contagious among them all night long and more so with every passing hour. He had never gotten used to the place, even though the dangerous foot patrol assignment was routinely meted out to him by his station chief. Blackburn realized that the continual Barbary Coast beat was intended as some sort of an ongoing affront to him, and that it was being done for the benefit of the rank-and-file officers. He just didn&#x2019;t have any good ideas as to what to do about it. His reputation as a widower who was far too obsessive in his police work naturally pleased the upper brass, but it also placed a lot of pressure on fellow officers: men with families, lives away from the job. Then some bright soul up in the command office figured out that with Blackburn&#x2019;s overactive code of ethics, he would work just as hard in the dangerous district as he did anywhere else. And so week after week, the dreaded assignments sent a morale-soothing message to the rank and file: Don&#x2019;t worry about Sergeant Blackburn, no matter how much of a fanatic he might be. Look at where he is. Nothing matters unless the right people like you. While he strode along the sidewalk, Blackburn tried to tell himself that the real reason he constantly drew the graveyard shift and the Barbary Coast assignments was because of his superior physical capability. But a voice in his head accused him of being the author of his own predicament. The back of his neck tightened at the unwelcome truth of it. On any night, it was a relief to leave the district behind at the end of a shift. That was especially true this morning; it had been a real &#x201c;ladies&#x2019; night&#x201d; along the Barbary Coast, and between the women and the men, the street corner hags were by far the most dangerous. Those bottom-rung females lived in a drunken haze, battered by lives of nonstop torment. He approached every one of them knowing that they would eagerly offer sex to a policeman to buy his tolerance, or just as eagerly snatch away his sidearm and shoot him in the face. Most were prepared to either live or die in the attempt, and it was all the same to them. Lately, while he kept a sharp eye out for their flurries of random rage, he also knew that the Department strongly suspected that at least one of these doomed women had somehow become highly skilled at throwing heavy-bladed knives. Blackburn himself had seen the grim products of the mysterious killer&#x2019;s work. Each of her victims had almost certainly fallen to the same knife, which left identically deep and wide cuts. The crime was always committed as a fast kill, always under cover of darkness. The consistent knifepoint entry at the back of the neck indicated surprise or ambush. The victim&#x2019;s spinal cord was usually split by the thick blade. Over a dozen such victims had turned up in less than nine months, with never a clue beyond a couple of reported glimpses of a &#x201c;small-framed woman&#x201d; seen hurrying away. No one even knew if this woman had any actual involvement in the crimes. That&#x2019;s how thin the evidence remained, after all this time and all those victims. Blackburn had personally found three of the bodies, on three separate occasions. Every one was castrated with precision and skill, postmortem. Not a single victim was robbed. It seemed as though the taking of the victim&#x2019;s life and the removing of his useless manhood were enough to complete the desired experience&#x2014;one longshoreman&#x2019;s body was even found with a sizeable wad of cash right inside the vest pocket. When the press got wind of the story, with macabre humor they dubbed the killer &#x201c;The Surgeon.&#x201d; The SFPD publicly speculated that The Surgeon was almost certainly a physically fit young woman, probably one who had fallen into ruinous ways. Perhaps she grew up on a farm, where she had learned her skill with the knife. Possibly butchering hogs. Since then, on most nights along the Barbary Coast, Blackburn had nothing more for company than the inevitable castration jokes that seemed to come from all directions. The night-beat clientele generally agreed that as long as they weren&#x2019;t the ones being killed, the best thing to do was to laugh it all off. And since Blackburn was under Chief Dinan&#x2019;s orders to keep an ear to the street, he had no choice but to spend his nights asking the same questions about the killings, over and over, and listening to the same handful of jokes in response. No one actually voiced open approval, but he couldn&#x2019;t help noticing that the sidewalk ladies were uniformly ignorant of any useful facts, free of any helpful theories. None was inclined to so much as guess who the ghoulish killer might be. And while they never went so far as to openly cheer The Surgeon&#x2019;s grisly work, that extra bit about slicing off the cocks of the dead men usually made them giggle whenever the topic came up. As for the killer&#x2014;Blackburn still hoped that there was only one. But throughout the past night&#x2019;s shift, with that crazed charge hovering in the air, he had half expected to trip over a collection of bled-out corpses at any moment. He kept fearing that a few of the other violence-prone whores might have started to find The Surgeon&#x2019;s behavior personally appealing. So tonight he was doubly glad when his shift ended without major trouble. He took extra long strides back to the station, making good time even though the predawn light was absorbed by the fog. With the gas streetlamps still burning at every corner, he could see just well enough to keep up his pace between the isolated pools of weak yellow light while he moved through the chilled mist. The sound of his heavy boot heels ricocheted off the cobblestones and echoed around the silent brick storefronts. The smell of early morning ham and egg breakfasts floated from a number of homes, tempting him to get back home to a meal of his own. He paused to check his silver pocket watch when he passed through a circle of pale gaslight near the corner post office at Mission and Seventh. He was only a few blocks away from the City Hall station, and it was only twelve minutes past five: record time. He liked that. It was as if more of the night&#x2019;s prickly energy had risen up from the ground and soaked through the soles of his boots with every step, filling him up as fast as he burned it away. He pocketed the watch and started to take a step outside of the lamplight, but just as he lifted his foot, the entire street jerked sideways and pulled itself out from under him. His footing vanished with such power that, for an instant, he thought that he had stepped on some drunk&#x2019;s sleeping blanket and gotten it snatched out from under his feet. Half a second later, the street&#x2019;s cobblestone surface jumped up and hit him with the rude force of a blind-side fist in a bar fight. His body slammed to earth and he took the pavement as a full frontal blow, barely reaching out in time to protect his face from the cold bricks. Spots filled his vision and his head rang with waves of pain that throbbed in time to his heartbeat. He heard his own voice cry out, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an earthquake!&#x201d; even as he fought to avoid blacking out. Instinct brought him to his hands and knees, moving his limbs with natural magic while the ground shuddered under him. But he remained in place. After a boyhood in Northern California, Blackburn had enough experience with earthquakes to know that it wasn&#x2019;t time to get up yet. He reassured himself that at least he was awake and knew what was happening&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t been ejected out of a warm bed and onto a cold floor, as most of the city&#x2019;s residents no doubt were. And most of whom were probably now lost to confusion and panic. Until the rattling died down, there wasn&#x2019;t any safer place to go. If he moved out of the range of falling bricks or stones from one building, he would only move into range of another. He thought about taking shelter in a doorway, but rejected that. In the heavy stone buildings that lined both sides of this street, a doorway might only prove to be a good place to get buried alive when the keystones gave way. He knew that if any structural damage had taken place during the bigger shock, then a building might only need another little rattle before coming apart. He told himself that with any luck, this first shock wave would be the worst of it. But just as he began to rise from his hands and knees, the street began a hard swirl that threw him onto his side. This movement was much stronger, coming not thirty seconds on the heels of the first shock wave. It rolled with such power that the best he could do was to scramble back down onto all fours and remain there on the ground. Beyond that, the shuddering earth was already telling him everything he needed to know. That first wave, he now realized with a cold rush, had not been the real earthquake. It was only a foreshock. Blackburn did not know if he yelled the words or not. And then it was more than just the idea of a major earthquake that leaped into his mind. It was all the dire implications that went along with it for a brittle city of bricks and mortar. They quickly became real. The violent rolling motion of the earth was joined by a vertical rise and fall. The ground dropped out from under him, then slammed back up again. Blackburn found himself clutching the back of a lurching beast. It was all so unreal that the first icy shot of mortal fear had not even hit him yet. All he knew, at that moment, was that he had never been through an earthquake like this one. Then abruptly, the ground&#x2019;s vertical movements slowed. All movement stopped. Quiet descended . . . And within seconds, everything was shrouded in a deathly silence. The air felt like a thick wet blanket that did not transmit sound. There was nothing reassuring in the absence of noise. The silence lasted for eight or nine slow heartbeats. And then a deep rumbling began. A pulse throbbed, far beneath the earth&#x2019;s surface. It was indescribably deep, so low on the tonal scale that he felt it in his bones and deep in his chest. For an instant, his memory flashed a boyhood image of putting his ear to a railroad track, listening for the vibrations of a faraway locomotive. Except now there was no track and no train. This rumbling sound was wrong, completely out of place. It was then that the first burst of real fear stabbed through him, stronger and colder than anything he had ever felt. It cut through his training, his life experience, and at that moment, if the rolling earth had allowed him to climb to his feet, the fear would have owned him and sent him screaming into the night. His instincts already sensed what the rest of him was about to learn. When he glanced down Mission Street, he stared into an impossible sight&#x2014;a massive surge of energy was running toward him, underneath the surface of the earth. It hurtled through the ground like a wave of curling surf. Solid earth was rolling like the sea itself. His brain seemed to freeze while the invisible monster shot toward him and trailed upheaval in its wake. Brick storefronts buckled and exploded. Granite paving stones blew upward like kernels of popping corn. By the time the energy wave hit him, Blackburn was a paralyzed statue of astonishment. The wave tossed him into the air. When he landed and the street curb crashed into his ribs, the blow knocked all of the wind out of him. Then he could do nothing more than lie helpless: ten seconds, twenty seconds, fighting the sensation that he was drowning on dry land. He rolled onto his hands and knees and managed to take a clear breath, but by then the invisible wave was long gone. The din of destruction overpowered his hearing. Behind him, the roof of the post office was gradually collapsing, and those sounds were only part of a much larger chorus. In all directions, buildings of every size were still shedding their stone exteriors like giant reptiles casting off skin. The ones that collapsed upon themselves expelled thick clouds of dust out the windows and doorways, coughing their guts into the streets before they died. He turned his head in a circle and caught shadowy glimpses of Armageddon. Never since losing his wife and child had Blackburn felt the overpowering need to cry. Now the choking sobs took him as if they had only been gone for a day. He cried out in wordless despair. It was several seconds before he regained control and strangled the feelings back down. The noises around him diminished at the same time that he managed to squelch his own outcries. In a self-conscious flash, he felt thankful to know that even if anybody was awake and looking out of their window and right at him, they were certainly far too distracted to have noticed his slip of emotion.</p><h2>A Sparrow Falls</h2><p>Sean Courtney returns to South Africa from the Great War to find his homestead taken over by unscrupulous developers, and he flees to the city and to the cause, and the wife, of a socialist revolutionary</p><p>These audiobooks from Macmillan UK offer abridged readings of some of the world�s most popular authors.

Even though <i>Mars and Venus on a Date</i> isn't <i>The Rules</i> by a long shot, the courtship it describes is surprisingly old-fashioned. It's chock-full of things your mother might say: "Most people find or are found by their soul mates when they are not really looking." "The man should never talk more than the woman." But how to know if the person you're with is your "soul mate?" Gray writes, "When our soul wants to marry our partner, it feels like a promise that we came into this world to keep."

The private journey was often at odds with his public life. As writer, radio commentator in New York and college professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lester's outspoken and unconventional views often angered blacks as well as whites, and placed him in a political and philosophical fray between blacks and Jews. His spiritual quest, begun here with a lovingly detailed sketch of his southern heritage, took many turns, involving visits to sites of faith (Gethsemani Abbey, Wounded Knee, Shakertown) and intensive exploration of religious cultures, until he acknowledged the pull of the Jewish faith. He discusses his interracial marriage and fatherhood, and pays moving tribute to the fulfillment he finds in celebrating the Jewish faith. Lester is the author of Look Out, Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama! and To Be a Slave. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Well-known author, academic, and former civil rights activist Lester takes the reader on an extraordinary spiritual odyssey that starts in the Forties with his childhood in segregated Nashville; continues through his years of avowed atheism and civil rights work, with accusations of anti-Semitism by whites and betrayal by blacks; and concludes with his conversion to Judaism. His search for meaning and faith lead him to Thomas Merton, Wounded Knee, and Protestant sources; his early discovery that his grandfather was Jewish eventually sparks his search for a Jewish identity. The path to conversion is difficult, but the result- ing "lovesong" to God is powerful and beautifully written. Recommended for wide audiences.

For Faith has done too much, knows too much, and will tell too much.<b><br><br></b>Feared by some of the most powerful men in the world, Faith has been targeted to die. But when a private investigator walks into the middle of the assassination attempt, the shooting suddenly goes wrong, and an FBI agent is killed. Now Faith Lockhart must flee for her life--with her story, her deadly secret, and an unknown man she's forced to trust...<b><br></b></p><p>It sounds like a movie pitch: "The story is like Tom Clancy crossed with John Grisham set in the Washington D.C. political world." But David Baldacci's <i>Saving Faith</i> successfully fuses elements from both of these chart-busters in this political thriller spiced with techno-wizardry. <p> The villain is a classic spy caricature: cold-war CIA super-patriot Robert Thornhill wants to reclaim the glory days of the Central Intelligence Agency--when money flowed like the Mississippi during a flood, and the FBI watched helplessly from the sidelines. Working from his secret underground bunker, he blackmails Danny Buchanan, one of the great Washington lobbyists, to front an enormous bribery scheme that will force Congress to bend to the CIA's whims. But Thornhill's plan springs a leak: Buchanan's assistant Faith Lockhart discovers her boss's dirty dealings, and she intends to expose the whole mess to Thornhill's nemesis, the FBI. Thornhill's associates attempt to assassinate Faith, but their bullet kills her FBI escort instead. Faith finds herself on the run with Lee Adams, a fit-and-trim PI who had been shadowing her at the behest of Buchanan.</p><p> If all this sounds a bit confusing, it is at times. Baldacci works hard to keep the tension steadily rising, but it is sometimes difficult to remember why Faith and Lee can't just stop running and go for help. Nevertheless, they are very likable heroes, and Baldacci's depiction of the world of lobbyists and the internecine warfare of the FBI and CIA (complete with state-of-the-art spy gadgets and transmission-proof chambers) elevates the novel with details that can come only from careful research. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>&#34;Not far from Washington, D.C., in a wooded area of Northern Virginia, a small house at the end of a gravel road serves a secret purpose.

Another man, a hired killer, stakes out the house on orders from his powerful paymasters.

The familiar little tug boat is off on another adventure that follows the format of Gramatky's earlier titles. Little Toot hears of the monster at Loch Ness and goes off to see for himself. The riverboats make fun of him, the search boats on the loch order him away, the fishing boat won't talk to him. But Little Toot perseveres, and meets at last a soft-spoken Nessie painted in soft, cuddly curves and cheerful greens and blues. When the search boats come too close, Little Toot distracts them long enough for Nessie to escape. It is not entirely clear which parts of the book are directly attributable to Hardie Gramatky. His daughter explains in an end note that at her father's death in 1979, the book consisted of "drafts, notebooks, sketches, and illustrations." She and her mother added illustrations, colored the sketches, and "worked" on the text. Comparisons of the style exhibited in the earlier "Little Toot" titles shows that a different artist has had a large role in creating the watercolor paintings for this book. That isn't a negative criticism, however, for the illustrations in . . . the Loch Ness Monster are frequently vivid and flowing, but some do have a somewhat unfinished, preliminary look to them. Little Toot still captivates small children, and the bright colors of this title should attract them. --Ruth Semrau, Lovejoy School, McKinney, TX<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.At the time of Gramatky's death in 1979, this book about the spirited little tugboat was nearly completed. The final draft was completed by his wife Dorothea Cooke Gramatky and his daughter, Linda Gramatky Smith. Little Toot's adventures began in the New York harbor 50 years ago; now he travels to Loch Ness, Scotland, to find out what a real monster looks like. When Little Toot arrives at the loch, he's greeted by a group of unfriendly--and threatening--boats also looking for Nessie. Frightened and alone by nightfall, he is suddenly confronted by a huge serpentlike monster with spines on its back. Nessie is quite different than what he expects; Little Toot not only keeps her secret from the boats in the loch but also those at home. Although the drawings are not polished and refined, the luminous watercolor illustrations evoke the dauntless independence of Little Toot. The text flows smoothly; the three-way collaboration will not disappoint fans of the earlier Little Toot stories.

Her job: to investigate crimes against wildlife. Unlike the majority of hunters who respect both their prey and the laws, evidence was piling up against an unscrupulous outfitter who was decimating populations of big game in Alaska's Brooks Range. In August 1992, she accepted an assignment that forever changed--and endangered--her life. She left her husband and seven-year-old daughter behind in Wisconsin and posed as a big-game hunter in Alaska in order to infiltrate an international ring of poachers out to kill the biggest and best of that state's wildlife.<br><br><b>A Hunt for Justice</b> recounts her dramatic story--a story she was not legally permitted to write about until her retirement in 2004.<br><br>Risking personal safety, Schroeder joined a team of government agents to expose and arrest the poachers.

More than simply an adventure or true-crime tale, it's a story of a woman surviving in a male-dominated field, a woman against the wilderness, and a wife and mother risking it all for a cause she believes in.

Jeffrey Veidlinger explores the venues in which prominent cultural figures&#x2015;including Sholem Aleichem, Mendele Moykher Sforim, and Simon Dubnov&#x2015;interacted with the general Jewish public, encouraging Jewish expression within Russia's multicultural society.

So Newsweek writer wrote of Sir Peter Medawar, the renowned British immunologist. "The most accomplished writer of popular-science essays," declared the Philadelphia Inquirer. Now this Nobel Prize-winning scientist and highly acclaimed author of Pluto's Republic, Aristotle to Zoos, and many other books has written a fascinating account of his own life.<br> <br>The image of man as a cross between Pascal's "thinking reed" and Falstaff's "forked radish," expressed in the title of Sir Peter's autobiography, stems from his humble desire "not to claim for myself as an author any distinction more extravagant than membership of the human race." But it is an exceptional life that unfolds in the pages of this incisive and witty memoir. Sir Peter describes his early years in Rio de Janiero, "the rude and barbaric life of Marlborough," Oxford in 1930s, his illnesses and recovery, and the rewards and frustrations of work in a wide variety of academic institutions around the world. Rich anecdotes abound--his early school days and family life, his musical education, his wife Jean and their family, his frequent visits to America, and much more. A sheer delight to read, this highly personal account illuminates the life of one of the most engaging and impressive men of out time.<br> <br> About the Author:<br> <br> Sir Peter Medawar won the 1960 Nobel Prize for Medicine.

Against this backdrop, twelve stories of ordinary lives explore the loneliness, fragility, and heartbreak inherent to love. Families feel the far-reaching shockwaves of displacement and division. A mother makes a hard choice for her sons when their father goes to lead a standoff with the federal government. An unemployed carpenter joins a militia after his wife leaves him and the first airstrikes raze the streets of his hometown. A former soldier raises the daughter of a dead comrade in a bunker beneath an abandoned farm.</p><p>Ranging from the cities to the small towns of the West, and imbued with its own brand of radical empathy, Loskutoff's fiction is both timely and timeless. <em>Come West and See</em> surges with rage, longing, and fear, and offers startling insights into the wounds of the American people.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2018:</strong> In "The Dancing Bear," the first story of Maxim Loskutoff's debut short story collection, <em>Come West and See</em>, a lonesome frontiersman falls hard for a grizzly that happens upon his Montana cabin. It&#x2019;s weird: <em>Her fur shimmered and rolled in waves, like the windy prairie where I was born. Her pink tongue swept away stray apple chunks from around her mouth. I wondered if she had lips.</em> As many tales of unrequited love go, especially in the boy-meets-bear genre, his passion cannot span the species gap, inexorably leading to misunderstanding and calamity. It's a funny story (if you have the right ear) and a solid hook, but from there Loskutoff drives the car back onto the highway to the world of human interaction, examining the complexities of a changing American West through a series of vignettes set in the imaginary "Redoubt": A cross-section of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming that's home to a separatist movement grown out of the occupation of a wildlife sanctuary. (If that sounds familiar, it's because a version of that happened.) But throughout the dozen stories, the simmering revolution largely stays (for the most part) in the background. Loskutoff's interest lies with the people of this vision of Sagebrush Rebellion&#x2014;the disenfranchised, resentful, and angry prepared to defend their "way of life" against the encroachments of changing demographics, environmentalism, and globalism. His characters hum with anxiety, each overstrung by the knowledge that disaster could visit at any moment, that their own actions have led them down a foolish and futile path&#x2014;even if they would choose it again. That's just what happens when you court a bear. <em>--Jon Foro, Amazon Book Review</em>Raised in small towns in the west, award-winning author Maxim Loskutoff&#39;s stories and essays have appeared in numerous periodicals, including The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, Ploughshares, and The Southern Review, as well as anthologies in the US and abroad.

Their mother's beach house is the only place any of them ever found true happiness and they need to begin the difficult process of letting go.

Morton examines the process of invention, innovation, and diffusion of communications technology, using the history of sound recording as the focus. <i>Off the Record </i>demonstrates how the history of both the hardware and the ways people used it is essential for understanding why any particular technology became a fixture in everyday life or faded into obscurity. Morton&#x2019;s approach to the topic differs from most previous works, which have examined the technology&#x2019;s social impact, but not the reasons for its existence. Recording culture in America emerged, Morton writes, not through the dictates of the technology itself but in complex ways that were contingent upon the actions of users.</p>Each of the case studies in the book emphasizes one of five aspects of the culture of recording and its relationship to new technology, at the same time telling the story of sound recording history. One of the misconceptions that Morton hopes to dispel is that the only important category of sound recording involves music. Unique in his broad-based approach to sound technology, the five case studies that Morton investigates are :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><ul><li>The phonograph record</li><li>Recording in the radio business</li><li>The dictation machine</li><li>The telephone answering machine, and</li><li>Home taping</li></ul>Readers will learn, for example, that the equipment to create the telephone answering machine has been around for a century, but that the ownership and use of answering machines was a hotly contested issue in the telephone industry at the turn of the century, hence stifling its commercial development for decades. Morton also offers fascinating insight into early radio: that, while The Amos and Andy Show initially was pre-recorded and not broadcast live, the commercial stations saw this easily distributed program as an economic threat: many non-network stations could buy the disks for easy, relatively inexpensive replaying. As a result, Amos and Andy was sold to Mutual and went live shortly afterward.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>When, in 1877, Thomas Edison and his associates invented the phonograph, he thought that it would be used primarily as a device for making home recordings, not as a tool for listening to recordings produced by others--a development, John Philip Sousa complained in 1906, certain to spell the end of "talent and taste."<p> In the more than a century that has passed, new technologies have come to make it ever easier for both the mass and individual production of recorded sound. David Morton traces the development of these audio-recording technologies, from wire spools to eight-track and DAT tapes, paying special attention to those that are available to the individual consumer. He notes that many of these technologies evolved to improve the quality of "highbrow" music despite the fact that most listeners used the resulting flood of audiophile goods to listen to anything but classical. He also follows the fortunes of voice-based recording devices such as the Dictaphone, which met with curious resistance (middle managers felt that the use of the machine was beneath them, while stenographers saw it as a threat to their specialization). Morton's sweeping survey ends just shy of the new era of MP3 and home-CD recording technologies, but fans of the new formats will doubtless be interested to see parallels with standards introduced in earlier years. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>David Morton examines the process of invention, innovation, and diffusion of communications technology, using the history of sound recording as the focus. Recording culture in America emerged, Morton writes, not through the dictates of the technology alone but in complex ways that were contingent upon the actions of users. Readers will learn, for example, that the equipment to create the telephone answering machine has been around for a century, but that the ownership and use of these items was a hotly contested issue in the telephone industry at the turn of the century. As a result, its commercial development was stifled for decades. Morton illustrates his broad-based approach to sound technology with five case studies: the phonograph record, recording in the radio business, the dictation machine, the telephone answering machine, and home taping. Each of these case studies dispels the popular notion that recording is all about music, and they tell a much more complete story of sound recording technology and history.</p><h2>McClellan&#39;s Other Story</h2><p>McClellan&#39;s Other Story--The Political Intrigue of Colonel Thomas M. Key, Confidential Aide to General George B. McClellan. Now available for the first time--the Untold Political History of the Civil War. This is the biography of Kentucky-born Colonel Thomas Marshall Key (1819-1869) who served as a Confidential Aide and Political Adviser on the staff of General George B. McClellan from 1861-1863. Recently discovered documents and letters reveal that the enigmatic Colonel Key was the author of most of McClellan&#39;s political orders and letters, including the infamous Harrison&#39;s Landing Letter of July 7, 1862 to Abraham Lincoln, warning the President not to turn the struggle into--a War of Emancipation. In their wartime and post-war writings, fellow staff officers criticized Colonel Key, calling him the Power Behind the Throne, and the Evil Genius of George McClellan, blaming him for his dubious political advice. McClellan&#39;s Othe Story contains numerous unpublished letters and documents, and will show evidence that Colonel Key&#39;s political interference prolonged the war and cost thousands of lives, and also effectively ruined the military career of General George B. McClellan.</p><p>William B. Styple has edited, co-authored, and authored over 25 books and documentaries on the American Civil War.

And only a pataphysician nurtured lovingly on surrealist excess could have come up with The Blue Flowers, Queneau's 1964 novel, now reissued as a New Directions Paperbook. To a pataphysician all things are equal, there is no improvement or progress in the human condition, and a "message" is an invention of the benighted reader, certainly not the author or his perplexing creations&#x2013;&#x2013;the sweet, fennel-drinking Cidrolin and the rampaging Duke d'Auge. History is mostly what the duke rampages through&#x2013;&#x2013;700 years of it at 175-year clips. He refuses to crusade, clobbers his king with the "in" toy of 1439&#x2013;&#x2013;the cannon&#x2013;&#x2013;dabbles in alchemy, and decides that those musty caves down at Altamira need a bit of sprucing up. Meanwhile, Cidrolin in the 1960s lolls on his barge moored along the Seine, sips essence of fennel, and ineffectually tries to catch the graffitist who nightly defiles his fence. But mostly he naps. Is it just a coincidence that the duke appears only when Cidrolin is dozing? And vice versa?

Felix, characteristically, arrives at the start of strange doings, set off by the hit-and-run death of Virginia's elderly neighbor. The victim's frail wife is hospitalized after surgery and, when she returns home, Virginia arranges for the widow's household help. Next, the murders of two women throw the community into an uproar, and force Virginia to suspect Felix, despite her conviction that his idiosyncratic ethical sense would never permit him to commit serious crimes. As she might have guessed, Virginia's secretive spouse has been using his talent for deceit in an effort that pays off with the arrest of the killers. The tale is lively with intrigue and urbane wit. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Keeper</h2><p>Review: &#39;A compelling and moving story, expertly told, that will draw you in and keep you in its grip until the last page.&#39; - DAILY EXPRESS &#39;Magnificent ... his writing is evocative and perfect.

For example, the Republican Left argued that German nationalism and militarism began after Kant, with Fichte or Hegel, while the Catholic and nationalistic reactionary Right denounced Kant as the evil inspiration of France's liberal democracy and public school system. The heated rhetoric of the war and the unbearable loss of young lives, says Hanna, lent weight to a redefinition of French culture in national terms&#x2015;and this, ironically, ended in the cultural conservatism of Vichy France.</p><p>This is the first study of the power of French pens and words during and after the Great War. It is a contribution to French and European history as well as to intellectual history.</p></p><p>France went to war in 1914 not only in the trenches but also in the mind. When President Poincare called upon the intellectual elite to contribute to the war effort with &#34;their pens and their words&#34;, the union sacree of scholars and writers - including Henri Bergson, Pierre Duhem, Ernest Lavisse, and Emile Durkheim - united French intellect against German Kultur. Yet, as Martha Hanna points out, there were ambiguities and insecurities in such fields as Kantian ideas, classicism, and science. Devoted to the defense of France and united in condemning the German onslaught, the French intelligentsia was nonetheless riven by the same fundamental divisions that had characterized it before the war. The Republican Left remained intent upon the preservation of the Third Republic and its principles; the Catholic and nationalistic Right sought to defend a more traditional France that respected hierarchy, classicism, and religious authority. The fragility of the facade of unity was particularly evident in the wartime controversy over Kant. The Left, finding his theory of moral obligation and individual autonomy compatible with its political culture, argued in his defense that German nationalism and militarism began after Kant, with Fichte, or Hegel, while the Right denounced the German philosopher as the evil inspiration of France&#39;s liberal democracy and public school system. The heated rhetoric of the war and the unbearable loss of young lives, says Hanna, lent weight to a redefinition of French culture in national terms - and this, ironically, ended in the cultural conservatism of Vichy France.Martha Hanna is Professor of History, University of Colorado at Boulder.</p><h2>Rick Steves Snapshot Copenhagen &amp; the Best of Denmark</h2><p>You can count on Rick Steves to tell you what you <i>really</i> need to know when traveling in Copenhagen and throughout the best of Denmark.<br><br>Rick Steves covers the essentials of Copenhagen and the best of Denmark, including Roskilde, Frederiksborg Castle, Legoland, and �r� Island.

Simultaneous.</p><p>The subtitle of <i>Descriptionary</i> says it's "the book for when you know what it is, but not what it's called." Pretty useful, eh? But that description is also a bit limiting, as this handy reference guide can be just as easily used as a standard dictionary when you do know what the word is. Rather than the alphabetical arrangement found in dictionaries and thesauruses, the words here are grouped according to general categories, such as animal and insects, food and drink, the human body and mind, and occupations. Within these broad areas are subheadings--"environment" has been divided into 30 categories ranging from atmosphere to wind. The word listings in these short sections are alphabetical, and while each has a straightforward explanation, you won't find alternative spellings, a pronunciation guide, or any of those dictionary-standard accompaniments to the definition.<p> So why use this instead of a standard dictionary? Mainly, in order to take advantage of the unusual word arrangement, as it can operate most efficiently when you're writing a paper about a specific topic. Civics students looking up "malfeasance" will find on the same page a variety of words that may spark new ideas and instantly increase practical vocabulary, as any words that catch your eye will be closely related to the topic at hand. Also great for students is the "1,050 Words and Expressions You Should Know" chapter--from "ad hoc" to "zealous," it covers words used regularly in magazines, newspapers, and textbooks. Adults learning a new skill or deciphering current events will find that the sections function nicely as a glossary; the sections on sports, politics, gardening, and cooking are especially helpful in this manner. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>e&#39;s a reference book that works the way the mind works, allowing students to locate that elusive word to the specific thing, e.g., What do you call that belt for a tuxedo?

Examples of the best textiles from each area are supplemented with numerous photographs of spinners, weavers, and dyers at work, and diagrams showing how the various effects are achieved. As well as providing students and anthropologists with a valuable insight into working methods in a wide variety of traditional communities, this book and the exciting textiles it illustrates will be an endless source of ideas and ispiration for practising weavers.</p><p><p>An illustrated study of traditional textile techniques in eight different areas of the world</p>Ann Hecht taught weaving, spinning, and dyeing for 17 years in adult education, and for many years she designed and produced the <i>Journal for Weavers, Spinners and Dyers.</i></p><h2>The Hundred Tales of Wisdom: Life, Teachings and Miracles of Jalaludin Rumi from Aflaki&#39;s Munaqib</h2><p>Collection of Tales, Anecdotes &amp; Narrations Used in Sufi Schools.</p><p>As the urgency of our global situation becomes apparent, more and more readers are turning to the books of Idries Shah (1924-1996) as a way to train new capacities and new ways of thinking. Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." <p>Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. </p><p>Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. </p><p>Shah's landmark book, "The Sufis", invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. </p><p>University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah's books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. </p><p>In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography's Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who's Who in Poetry's Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). </p><p>According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph "it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable". </p><p>He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age. </p><p>"The most interesting books in the English language."

The trail leads Charlie into the fevered landscape of America's southern border and the unexplored depths of humanity's dark soul.</p><p><strong>Robert Crais and T. Jefferson Parker: Author One-on-One</strong> <p> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together blockbuster authors Robert Crais and T. Jefferson Parker and asked them to interview each other. </p> <p> <strong>Robert Crais</strong> is the author of the best-selling Joe Pike and Elvis Cole novels and the 2006 recipient of the Ross Macdonald Literary Award. Crais lives in the Santa Monica mountains with his wife, three cats, and many thousands of books. </p> <p> Read on to see Robert Crais's questions for T. Jefferson Parker, or turn the tables to see what Parker asked Crais. </p> <strong>Crais:</strong> Though you've revisited characters earlier in your career, you've mostly written standalone novels. But now with <i>The Border Lords</i>, this is, what, your fourth Charlie Hood novel in a row? This is great news because I love to read about Charlie, but I'm curious why you love to write him. What is it about Charlie Hood that brings you back to him again and again? <br> <br> <strong>Parker:</strong> Glad you like him, Bob. Yeah, it&#x2019;s Charlie&#x2019;s fourth book and I&#x2019;m going to do two more. I like Charlie because he&#x2019;s a good reliable witness to events, and he always tries to do the right thing, and thus far in the series, he&#x2019;s constantly over-matched. Which is different than being hapless. I love an underdog. You&#x2019;d think the fact that Charlie is not only a Los Angeles Sheriff&#x2019;s deputy and a member of a federal ATF task force would make him very much the overdog. But he's not. Charlie&#x2019;s world in <i>The Border Lords</i> is Mexico, where the law is weak and wickedness prevails. He&#x2019;s the little guy. But he&#x2019;s smart, principled and brave, too. <br> <br> <strong>Crais:</strong> We've been at this game a long time. Between us, that's a lot of crime novels, bro. You ever consider writing something completely different? I know you're an avid fisherman. Ever fantasize about writing the Jeff Parker version of <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>? <br> <br> <strong>Parker:</strong> I do think about writing something other than crime novels, then my nasty little imagination kicks in and I&#x2019;m off on another crime! I got to write a &#x201c;fishing mystery&#x201d; that was published earlier this year, so that was a nice compromise. But even that turned criminal. I remember a birthday party I went to when I was seven years old. They had a whole bunch of costumes you could choose from &#x2013; you could be a cowboy or an Indian or a Martian or whatever. Just dress up and wreak havoc with the other little savages. So what did little Jeffy pick? I picked a devil costume. Man, what does that say? <br> <br> <strong>Crais:</strong> Pbooks or Ebooks? Do you care? <br> <br> <strong>Parker:</strong> I hate e-books and electronic reading gadgets and wish they&#x2019;d all go away. But of course they won&#x2019;t. I also think books are going to be around a lot longer than some people think/want. They&#x2019;ll be secretly trafficked by unrepentant book lovers, a full-on black market. Want the new Bob Crais in hardcover? A thousand bucks, man. Sold! <br> <br> <strong>Crais:</strong> You and I have both had a film adapted from our novels, me with <i>Hostage</i>, and you with <i>Laguna Heat</i>. I tend to avoid Hollywood's overtures, but a lot of our writer friends like Mike Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and Harlan Coben have allowed their work to be developed with pretty good results. What's your take on Hollywood? Any chance we'll see Charlie Hood at the movies? <br> <br> <strong>Parker:</strong> Charlie&#x2019;s under an option right now with Lionsgate, on behalf of Carl Franklin, whose work I love. My whole experience with <i>Laguna Heat was positive</i>, and I&#x2019;d like to see another TJP movie. But I feel protective of Charlie Hood, also. I wouldn&#x2019;t let him go to just anybody. In fact I&#x2019;ve demanded to star as Charlie if the movie gets made, which my agent says is a possible deal-killer. No, seriously, I&#x2019;d love to see a good movie. <br> <br> <strong>Crais:</strong> Tell the truth, Jeff--what's your favorite snack food when you're writing? <br> <br> <strong>Parker:</strong> Used to be cigarettes! But now it&#x2019;s anything containing peanut butter. Those little orange Keebler crackers with the peanut-butter between &#x2018;em? Oh, man. Start me up.

These men's bravery cannot be overestimated, nor can the resourcefulness and despair that led to the development of their crafts, which were so hazardous as to be properly described as suicide machines. Suicide Squads tells the story of these missions, focusing on the "special attack" operations - a euphemism for suicidal attacks - of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy. <p>Military historian Richard O'Neill offers a detailed exploration - including the evolution, the types, and the effects - of explosive motorboats (which offered "the prospect of spectacular gain at little cost"), midget submarines (Japanese, Italian, German, and British), and manned aircraft, as well as human torpedoes, human bullets, and kamikaze aircraft. He also describes the actions themselves - the attack on Pearl Harbor, the raid on Sydney Harbor, and Special Forces missions at Guadalcanal, Midway, and Okinawa, among others. And he provides insights into the samurai and bushido codes of conduct that inspired ritual suicide. </p><p>The story of these special attack forces remains a testimony to ingenuity, desperation, and courage.</p></p><p></p><h2>Maia &amp; What Matters</h2><p>Maia and What Matters</p><p></p><h2>The Body in Pieces: The Fragment as a Metaphor of Modernity</h2><p>By the end of the eighteenth century a sense of anxiety and crisis began to preoccupy European writers and artists in their relationship to a heroic past. The grandness of that history no longer fit into the framework of the present, and artists felt overwhelmed by the magnitude of past heroic accomplishment. This was soon reflected in artistic representation, from Fuseli on. The partial image, the "crop," fragmentation, ruin, and mutilationall expressed grief and nostalgia for the loss of a vanished totality, a utopian wholeness. Often such feelings were expressed in deliberate destructiveness, which became the new way of seeing: the notion of the modern. In <i>The Body in Pieces</i>, the noted critic and art historian Linda Nochlin traces these developments by looking at work produced by artists from Neoclassicism and Romanticism to Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Surrealism, and beyond. 59 illustrations.</p><p>Linda Nochlin was the Lila Acheson Wallace professor of modern art emerita at New York University&#x2019;s Institute of Fine Arts. Her publications include The Body in Pieces: The Fragment as a Metaphor of Modernity; Women, Art and Power and Other Essays; The Politics of Vision: Essays on Nineteenth-Century Art and Society; Courbet; Mise`re: The Visual Representation of Misery in the 19th Century; and Women Artists: The Linda Nochlin Reader. Her essay &#x201c;Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?&#x201d; is considered one of the most in influential texts in modern art history.A sequence of succinct and illuminating details...she matches method and subject to perfection. -- <i><i>The Art Book</i></i></p><h2>Amsterdam</h2><p>Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday are former lovers of the recently-deceased Molly Lane. They make a pact following her funeral, which both tests their friendship to the limits and has consequences neither has foreseen. This is the 1998 Booker Prize winner.</p><p>When good-time, fortysomething Molly Lane dies of an unspecified degenerative illness, her many friends and numerous lovers are led to think about their own mortality. Vernon Halliday, editor of the upmarket newspaper the <i>Judge</i>, persuades his old friend Clive Linley, a self-indulgent composer of some reputation, to enter into a euthanasia pact with him. Should either of them be stricken with such an illness, the other will bring about his death. From this point onward we are in little doubt as to <i>Amsterdam</i>'s outcome--it's only a matter of who will kill whom. In the meantime, compromising photographs of Molly's most distinguished lover, foreign secretary Julian Garmony, have found their way into the hands of the press, and as rumors circulate he teeters on the edge of disgrace. However, this is McEwan, so it is no surprise to find that the rather unsavory Garmony comes out on top. Ian McEwan is master of the writer's craft, and while this is the sort of novel that wins prizes, his characters remain curiously soulless amidst the twists and turns of plot. <i>--Lisa Jardine</i>On a chilly February day, two old friends meet in the throng outside a London crematorium to pay their last respects to Molly Lane. Both Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday had been Molly's lovers in the days before they reached their current eminence: Clive is Britain's most successful modern composer, and Vernon is editor of the newspaper "The Judge. Gorgeous, feisty Molly had other lovers, too, notably Julian Garmony, Foreign Secretary, a notorious right-winger tipped to be the next prime minister. <br>In the days that follow Molly's funeral, Clive and Vernon will make a pact with consequences that neither could have foreseen. Each will make a disastrous moral decision, their friendship will be tested to its limits, and Julian Garmony will be fighting for his political life.

Is Priscilla really channeling her inner gorilla, or is she just a troublemaker in ape&#x2019;s clothing?</p><p>Barbara Bottner is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of over forty books including <i>Priscilla Gorilla</i>,&nbsp;<i>Miss Brooks&#x2019; Story Nook</i>,<i> Wallace&#x2019;s Lists</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bootsie Barker Bites.&nbsp;</i>She is also a screenwriter and writing coach who began her career as an artist and actor.

Maria!,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;Barbara Bottner&#x2019;s <i>Miss Brooks&#x2019; Story Nook</i>. Michael lives in Ireland.Priscilla is not a gorilla, but she sure loves everything about them. Six-year-old Priscilla has made her dad read All About Gorillas to her a "million skillion times!" When her mom asks why she loves gorillas so much, Priscilla responds, "They always get their way." Her mother opines that Priscilla gets her way a lot already. But at school, Priscilla's enthusiasm for simians sometimes gets her sent to the Thinking Corner. When, on picture day, Mr. Todd has the class give reports on their favorite animals while in costume, Priscilla wants to keep her gorilla jammies on for the picture...and ends up out of the picture and in the Thinking Corner. Her classmates follow her lead, though, and soon the Thinking Corner is pretty crowded. Her parents point out some cooperative traits common in gorillas, sparking a change in behavior if not in heart. After Priscilla apologizes to Mr. Todd (sort of), the class trip to the zoo is a gorillastravaganza. Bottner's tale of ape adoration is sweetly spot-on. Primary schoolchildren will identify with Priscilla, her obsession, and her multiracial classmates. Emberley's watercolor-and-pencil illustrations telegraph every emotion, from childish exuberance to patient parental love. The four pages of the famous gorilla dance at the close are worth the price of admission. Priscilla and her dad have black hair and light brown skin; her black-haired mom's skin is a shade pinker. A precious and precocious primate parable sure to please. (Picture book. 4-8)&nbsp; -- Kirkus, STARRED REVIEW, <i>12/15/16</i><br><br>Since age six, Priscilla has been fascinated by gorillas (she particularly likes that gorillas &#x201c;always get their way&#x201d;). Priscilla&#x2019;s enthusiasm at inappropriate times results in her being &#x201c;invited&#x201d; to the class Thinking Corner. Things come to a head when Priscilla refuses to remove her gorilla outfit for the class picture, and soon her other classmates join her at the Thinking Corner in solidarity. Priscilla&#x2019;s father points out that gorillas are known for helping one another and cooperating, and Priscilla, fortified by this new knowledge, is able to get back in the good graces of her teacher. All ends well with a class trip to the ape house at the zoo and a spontaneous gorilla dance. Emberley&#x2019;s lively illustrations not only masterfully capture the activity and drama inherent in Bottner&#x2019;s text, but also expand the personalities of the supporting characters, making them fully three-dimensional. There is no villain here, just a clash of wills, showing that, like gorillas, we can all get along if we try. &#x2014; Randall Enos -- Booklist, <i>January 1, 2017</i><br><br>In a funny, empathic, and refreshingly unsentimental take on childhood, the team behind&nbsp;<i>Miss Brooks Loves Books (And I Don&#x2019;t)</i>&nbsp;and other titles introduces Priscilla, a gorilla-obsessed first grader. Priscilla&#x2019;s passion goes far beyond a mastery of fun facts: gorillas &#x201c;always get their way,&#x201d; she tells her mother, and this perceived ability to call the shots speaks deeply to Priscilla&#x2019;s independent spirit and skepticism of authority&#x2014;especially when that authority is her put-upon teacher, Mr. Todd. But Priscilla&#x2019;s silverback act soon starts taking its toll on the classroom&#x2014;so many peers emulate her that everyone ends up doing time in the euphemistically named Thinking Corner&#x2014;and something has to give. Emberley&#x2019;s watercolors, which channel the mischievous intelligence of Sendak, are wonderful at conveying personality through body language: a single drawing of Mr. Todd putting on his coat while announcing a field trip instantly communicates that this is a teacher with a solution to the Priscilla problem. And Priscilla, with her outsize confidence and (eventual) willingness to see a different perspective, is the perfect heroine for our times. Ages 4&#x2013;7.&nbsp; -- Publishers Weekly *STARRED REVIEW*, <i>January 2, 2017</i><br><br>With the single-minded focus of a kindergartner with a new obsession, Priscilla eats, sleeps, and breathes gorillas. After receiving a most wondrous book called All About Gorillas, the girl informs her mother that she likes gorillas because &#x201c;They always get their way.&#x201d; Her beleaguered teacher, Mr. Todd, does his best to deal with the onslaught of continuous gorilla art, interpretive dance moves, jungle calls, and perpetual costumes. Ultimately, his enthusiastic charge is invited to the &#x201c;Thinking Corner.&#x201d; Priscilla informs her parents that the only thinking she does there is about how she doesn&#x2019;t like the &#x201c;Thinking Corner.&#x201d; When her friends at school catch her wild animal bug and begin insisting on dressing up as their own favorite animals, Mr. Todd takes matters into his own hands and proposes a field trip to the zoo. Priscilla comes face-to-face with her hero, and everyone breaks into spontaneous gorilla dancing, including the suddenly uninhibited Mr. Todd. Emberley&#x2019;s delightfully wacky illustrations capture Bottner&#x2019;s colorful narrative. This author/illustrator duo do a dynamite job of portraying what all early education teachers should have the freedom and funding to do&#x2014;follow and build on the interests of their students. VERDICT This is an exceptional pairing of language and art. Its humor and fresh message give it wide appeal, and its positive depiction of a male teacher makes it a standout among stories about kindergarten classrooms. -- School Library Journal *STARRED*, <i>February 2017</i></p><h2>Tau Zero (SF Masterworks)</h2><p>Poul Anderson&#39;s Tau Zero is an outstanding work of science fiction, in part because it combines two qualities that are often at odds in this genre: an interest in the emotional lives of its characters and a fascination with all things technological and scientific</p><p></p><h2>Wisdom of the Last Farmer: Harvesting Legacies from the Land</h2><p>A slow-food advocate and award-winning author of Epitaph for a Peach describes his reevaluation of farming life in today&#39;s world after his father suffered a debilitating stroke, his reclaim of ancestral wisdom while nursing his father back to health, and his impassioned perspectives on the importance of connecting to the land.</p><p>David Mas Masumoto is an organic peach and grape farmer who works with his wife, Marcy Masumoto, and their two children, Nikiko and Korio, on their 80-acre farm just outside Del Ray, 20 miles south of Fresno, CA.

I had been working too fast, trying to keep pace with the warm spring days and early rains and the ensuing assault of weeds. My dad works behind the shed, wandering around his tractor.</p><p>It's February and our eighty-acre organic farm in California explodes with life. Peaches and nectarines are blooming, and grapevines are pushing out pale green buds with miniature bunches of grapes. In three months, if all goes well, we will gorge ourselves on the first peaches of the season. In six months, we can dry the bulbous grapes into raisins.</p><p>But the weeds are flourishing, too. Innocent-looking for a day or so, they keep growing, spreading thick over the landscape until, soon, a lush, tangled mass of fibers competes for water, nutrients, and sunlight, stunting the development of my crops, robbing fruits of the essentials they need to grow fat.</p><p>I am an organic farmer of peaches, nectarines, and grapes in Central Valley, California. Organic farming is not simple or easy, and the physical work breaks me. Everyone tells my father and me that it's too hard to farm organically and survive financially, to make money at it. It's easy to want to be environmentally responsible, but it's a damned hard thing to achieve. I cannot replace tedious labor with faster technology or equipment when things go wrong.</p><p>My father and I do most of the work ourselves. With our budget getting tighter and tighter every year, our farm demands more and more hard labor. It's exhausting. If we miss a few worms when they appear on leaves or on young fruit, a ruinous outbreak can ensue that we can't fix with a fast-killing chemical spray. An infestation is like catching a bad flu with no medicine readily available. I often whisper to myself, "This farm is going to kill me." So, this week, I have asked my seventy-six-year-old father to do some extra disking for me -- to help cultivate and plow under the weeds. For a moment,I believe I might catch up.</p><p>Dad shuffles around his tractor as the engine roars. He looks perplexed. At first I wonder if he's trying to listen for something wrong with the engine.</p><p>Dad is great at repairs. He had to be, since our family was poor. My grandparents emigrated from Japan a hundred years ago with dreams of owning a farm. Instead, they found racist alien land laws that prevented foreign-born "Orientals" from buying property. So they worked and waited, expecting that their American-born children would be able to purchase land and establish a farm, but World War II intervened and they were all relocated to internment camps, together with all Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Because they looked like the enemy, our family spent four years behind barbed wire in the Arizona desert. Afterward, with no other place to go, they wandered back to Fresno, California. In 1950, after more years of field work, Dad finally realized his own father's dream and was able to buy our farm.</p><p>Like most farms in the area, we started with grapes for drying into raisins, muscats for cheap wine, and stone fruits -- plums, peaches, and nectarines. Eventually we gravitated into mostly peaches and grapes because they worked well in our soil, and we loved to eat them, especially the rejects that grew too soft to sell.</p><p>Isolated and without capital, Dad quickly learned how to restore and repair old equipment, to tackle farmwork creatively and make the most of situations. Accept, adapt, adopt. That's how he and many Japanese Americans survived. I believe that's why he and I worked well together when I came back from college and started us at the bottom of the learning curve for organic farming. I wanted to grow crops without herbicides, fungicides, or pesticides. So, since I had inherited my father's passion for hard work and his love of heirloom fruits, we became partners. Dad allowed me to farm with alternative, unproven methods, and we made mistakes together, learned as a team how to farm differently. Dad taught me the power of recognizing problems, analyzing them, and identifying new ways to go about things.</p><p>We have finally begun to make headway in the fields and the market. Recently, we'd begun to be rewarded for our efforts by the increasing number of consumers of organic fruit who demand authentic flavors. The delicious tastes and aromas that Dad and I seek in our fruit cannot be mass-produced or manufactured. They come only from nature -- and authentic work. They stem from a joint effort between farmers and our living materials -- often more artful effort than applied science. In spite of our progress, however, we'd come to a point where the only way I knew how to meet our own and our customers' expectations was to work harder. But if we kept going as we were, we would soon reach a breaking point. Farming necessarily takes part in the cycles of life and death, but we organic farmers want to concentrate more on the former than the latter, on growing life-giving food with life-enhancing methods. We want to bring life to fruition, to be part of the creation and preservation of good things. We want to take joy in our work, not kill ourselves with it.</p><p>Yet organic farming continually challenges us: We have to weed by hand, and readjust our equipment to accommodate different scales of operation and procedures than those on automated industrial farms. We monitor our crops constantly in order to get rid of worms and insects before they proliferate and take over. Plant diseases -- molds, fungi, viruses -- demand that we experiment with simple but unreliable treatments. All our methods take vast amounts of time -- plus we have to anticipate the weather, react quickly to changes in temperature and wet and dry conditions, and always, always respond to nature, when she is predictable and when she is not. The rewards, though, are wonderful: we have saved from extinction distinctive heirloom peaches and nectarines whose nectar explodes on the palate, as well as grapes that make sweet, plump raisins.</p><p>Dad is a gentle, quiet father. I believe that he was happy when I took over the farm two decades ago, but he rarely expresses it. I sense that it pains him to see me work so hard. He knows too well the toll of all this physical exertion. He rarely complains; I only hear from Mom about his long, restless hours of back pain as his body ages.</p><p>I walk up and stand next to Dad by the tractor, and we lean together toward its thundering engine to listen. Then I look at his face. He is having a stroke: the right side of his face droops, his eyelid almost sealed shut, his eyes glazed. He looks lost and he doesn't recognize me.</p><p>As he begins to limp around the tractor, I hold on to him, trying to keep him from stumbling, falling. I don't know what to do, but think I should first shut off the engine and then get him inside the house. I feel responsible. In my drive to grow the perfect peach and the sweetest raisins, have I contributed to this sudden illness of my father? Could he die because of me?</p><p>I manage to turn off the engine, and as the tractor rumbles to a stop, I try to maneuver Dad inside. But he fights me, insisting on returning to his tractor. Still in shock, I give in to his will, feeling such guilt. Dad reaches for the tractor-seat cushion. At the end of the work day, we traditionally flip up the pad so that the morning dew will not collect on it and bother the next driver. With a trembling left hand, he flips it, then allows me to guide him away, his right arm -- his dominant hand -- dangling as if lifeless. Together, we limp toward the farmhouse.<br></p><b>� � �</b><br><p>A few days following Dad's stroke, I discover tracks into the farmyard from what I believe may have been his last tractor drive. The soft dirt captures his weaving and swerving as he frantically returned from the vineyards.</p><p>Dad had been working the vines with our tractor, dragging a tandem disc that plows weeds. Our yellow tandem has sixteen circular blades divided into four gangs. The two halves of this equipment mirror each other, which is why it is called a "tandem." The gangs are adjustable so we can extend them wide to cut weeds that are closer to the vines, or keep them centered down the middle of the rows. At this time of year we set the disc out wide so that it can reach into the vine berm to plow under small weeds before they grow larger and become even bigger problems in a few months.</p><p>Disoriented from the stroke, Dad parked the tandem and tractor behind the shed at an odd angle. Big chunks of a couple of old grapevines that had been torn off are lodged in the right front gang.</p><p>The tire tracks lead from the shed down two short avenues. The twisting trail is not hard to follow but painful for me to see. Dad struggled so hard to steer straight as his brain was assaulted by the stroke.</p><p>I trace the tracks back to rows 25 and 26 in our oldest vineyard, a nine-acre block that we called the Eleven-Foot Vines. The rows there are spaced eleven feet apart, whereas in most modern vineyards the spacing is wider, typically twelve feet, in order to accommodate larger equipment. Horses and mules may have worked well in eleven-foot rows, but not tractors. Because all our other vines are spaced at twelve feet, we always have to adjust equipment like the tandem to fit these narrower rows and avoid the risk of taking out a vine.</p><p>Half of these vines are close to one hundred years old. When originally planted, there had been forty vines in each of the sixty-five rows; but these rows contained seventy-five vines each. Dad and his brother, my uncle Alan, had extended the rows in 1953, a few years after Dad had bought the farm. In fact, they were planting these new vines when my grandfather, Dad's and Uncle Alan's own father, had a stroke and died on another part of the farm.</p><p>Halfway down row 25, three vines have been ripped out of the ground along with their metal stakes. The trellis wires are snapped, the stakes bent and tossed to the side. Two of the vines lie on their sides, most ...</p></p><h2>Helen Stevens Embroidered Birds</h2><p>This third title in renowned textile artist Helen M Stevens&#39; Masterclass Embroidery Series concentrates on birds of all kinds seen, as always, in their natural setting and brilliantly portrayed through the medium of Helen&#39;s own silk embroideries.

In a radical new interpretation, leading military historian Gary Sheffield argues that while the war was tragic, it was not futile; and, although condemned as 'lions led by donkeys', in reality the British citizen army became the most effective fighting force in the world, which in 1918 won the greatest series of battles in British history.<br>A challenging and controversial book, FORGOTTEN VICTORY is based on twenty years of research and draws on the work of major scholars.

Fox, pioneer in the development of sports medicine and the use of arthroscopy, and member of the medical staff for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, pulls no punches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you're a novice at knee pain or an old pro at hobbling around, he tells you exactly what you need to know to have strong, healthy, pain-free knees.</p><p>Bum knees have sidelined professional and amateur athletes alike, and until recently, the diagnosis was I.D.K., an acronym for internal knee derangement that specialists joked actually stood for "I Don't Know." The prognosis has improved somewhat, and orthopedic surgeon Fox and veteran medical writer McGuire offer a definitive book on the knee that will encourage a wide audiencefrom athletes to arthritics. A delightful bedside manner is enhanced by their gift for visualizing difficult images in easy-to-understand terms (the anatomy lesson describes the knee joint as "two giant bones propped on top of one another, held together by the anatomical equivalent of rubber bands"). Save Your Knees explains how the knee works, why it gets hurt, how to self-diagnose problems and when and when not to worry about them, and how to find reliefin surgery, exercise therapy, properly fitting shoes and the like. The book discusses questions a patient should ask a physician, as well as pain pills and potions. There are a sport-by-sport breakdown on how to prevent knee injury and a section on exercises that can be performed at home. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Fox (a physician) and McGuire (editor of Knee News and Sports Medicine ) offer a readable study of the knee, its pathology, and injury for the layperson. They cover most of the material in four sections: symptoms and causes of knee problems, possible treatments and rehabilitation, considerations when pursuing an athletic lifestyle, and problems of children and adolescents. Though Fox is a surgeon, he generally espouses an initially conservative, noninvasive approach to treatment. This book has fewer illustrations than Alan Halpern's Runner's World Knee Book ( LJ 2/1/85), but the information is comparable. At the price, Save Your Knees is worthwhile for public libraries.

Each book contains two novels jointly written by the duo, featuring different detectives solving crimes in different cities. In the Land of the Giants has Boston homicide detectives Michael MacCain and Doris Sylvestor investigating the suspicious death of a college basketball star. And in Still Life, the co-worker of a Santa Fe art gallery is murdered, forcing detectives Darryl Two Moons and Steve Katz to put aside holiday celebrations and set things right. Jonathan and Faye Kellerman live with their children in Southern California.PAGES: 256</p><p>Two short novels by a couple who've each gone it alone very successfully in their previous literary efforts make for a double treat for fans of both authors--Faye, whose mysteries feature a similarly uxorious couple in Rina and Peter Decker, and Jonathan, whose Alex Delaware novels starring a thoughtful child psychologist who's luckier in crime-busting than in love are even more popular. Not as satisfying as each author's full-length efforts, <i>Double Homicide</i> nonetheless offers a tasty side dish for their fans, and their protagonists venture beyond Los Angeles to tread new geographical territory, too. In Boston, a popular college athlete is slain in a busy nightclub, but what seems like an open-and-shut case turns out to hinge on forensic evidence that points to a very different conclusion. Detectives Michael McCain and Doris Breton unravel the mystery in Beantown, while two other new characters, Darryl Two Moons and his partner Steve Katz, discover that gallery owner Larry Olafson's brutal slaying has repercussions that resonate far beyond Santa Fe's trendy Canyon Road. Neither of these novellas makes the most of either author's gifts at character development, which lend themselves to a longer format, but that won't stop their dedicated readers from snapping them up and savoring them until the Deckers or Dr. Delaware turn up in their next adventures. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Faye Kellerman is the author of the hugely successful Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus thrillers, as well as a non-series thriller, MOON MUSIC, and a historical novel, THE QUALITY OF MERCY.

But if you&#39;ve tried these without much success, you&#39;re not alone. Many highly reactive couples-pairs that are quick to argue, anger, and blame-need more than just the run-of-the-mill relationship advice to solve their problems in love. When destructive emotions are at the heart of problems in your relationship, no amount of effective communication or intimacy building will fix what ails it. If you&#39;re part of a &#39;high-conflict&#39; couple, you need to get control of your emotions first, to stop making things worse, and only then work on building a better relationship. The High-Conflict Couple adapts the powerful techniques of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) into skills you can use to tame out-of-control emotions that flare up in your relationship. Using mindfulness and distress tolerance techniques, you&#39;ll learn how to deescalate angry situations before they have a chance to explode into destructive fights. Other approaches will help you disclose your fears, longings, and other vulnerabilities to your partner and validate his or her experiences in return. You&#39;ll discover ways to manage problems with negotiation, not conflict, and to find true acceptance and closeness with the person you love the most.</p><p>Alan E.

The group of conspirators with whom he conceived a plot to kill Hitler in July 1944 was called &#x201c;Secret Germany.&#x201d; That was also the name of the esoteric circle in which Stauffenberg as a young man had been a disciple of the mystic anti-Nazi magus and poet Stefan George. What were the motivations of this extraordinary aristocratic soldier, with the looks of a Hollywood idol and reputed to be the only man to stare the Fuhrer down until he averted his eyes? <br><br>For Stauffenberg, the bomb plot was not a political move but a moral and spiritual necessity. After forty-two serious attempts on Hitler&#x2019;s life in the previous twenty years, why did he not succeed? Had he done so, some would say he would have become the de Gaulle of Germany, saviour of the nation&#x2019;s soul. Even in failure, there can be no doubt of Stauffenberg&#x2019;s heroism. He stands as atonement for the Third Reich and a resolution of the conflicting myths of German culture. In this remarkable investigation, his whole life explains a troubled past to the present generations of Europeans.</p><p>Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh have co-authored a number of books including the international bestsellers <b>The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail</b>, <b>The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception</b> and <b>The Elixir and the Stone</b>.</p><h2>Aquarius Descending (Elizabeth Chase Mysteries)</h2><p>Martha C.

In a first-person narration, Wiener explains that he was 13 when the German soldiers killed his father; he was 15 when the Nazis came for him. The descriptions of his experiences in the concentration camps are accompanied by Orback&#x2019;s Norman Rockwell like illustrations that convey the horror of the time period. The brightly hued illustrations of the small town of Chrzanow are in stark contrast to the dark and agonizing depictions of the camps. Among the darkness and despair, however, came an unexpected gift from the enemy: a German factory worker left him a sandwich every day for the 30 days he worked in the building. The book concludes with an afterword by Wiener, a paragraph explaining the Holocaust, vocabulary, discussion questions, and recommended activities.

"But you're not going to like it."<br><br>"I'm sure I can handle it," Jessica said, tapping a foot impatiently.<br><br>"Well, Amy and I ran into Enid at the mall on Sunday," Lila began.<br><br>"Enid was trying on a black tube dress at Bibi's," Amy put in.<br><br>"Pouring on a tube dress is more like it," Lila said with a smirk.<br><br>Jessica stamped her foot impatiently. "Would you get to the point?" she asked.<br><br>"Well let's just say that Enid was looking a little lovesick," Lila said.<br><br>Jessica rolled her eyes. "So tell me something I don't know," she said sarcastically. "The drip has a crush on Jonathan.<br><br>"Amy laughed. "And it looks like Jonathan has a crush on the drip."<br><br>Jessica narrowed her eyes. "What are you talking about?"<br><br>"Enid had a hickey on her neck," Lila explained. "From Jonathan."<br><br>Jessica gasped. "What?" she exclaimed. She pictured Jonathan kissing Enid the way he had kissed her, and she felt sick. She imagined him touching her chalky cheeks and kissing her messy red lips. She saw him pushing back her tar black hair and sucking at her neck. Jessica felt dizzy all of a sudden. The image of Jonathan and Enid together was revolting. No, it was more than revolting. It was grotesque. It wasn't possible. Jessica shook her head. "I don't believe it."<br><br>Amy shrugged. "Go check it out for yourself."<br><br>"See you later," Lila said, waving as they walked away.<br><br>Jessica turned and marched down the hall, her blood boiling. Had she been outdone by the drip? She stalked down the corridor, heading for the vacant lockers near the back door where she could be alone. And Enid isn't just competing with me, Jessica thought, her fury mounting. She's trying to steal Jonathan!<br><br>Jessica turned a corner and punched a locker in rage, the sound reverberating in the empty corridor. If the story was true, Enid was going to be sorry. Jessica didn't know how she was going to do it, but she'd get her revenge. Enid Rollins would rue the day she ever set eyes on Jonathan Cain.</p><h2>Prayer, Fear, and Our Powers: Finding Our Healing, Release, and Growth in Christ</h2><p>In Prayer, Fear, and Our Powers Flora Wuellner once again blesses the reader with her gentle, inviting style.

His girlfriend Connie is in the clutches of Jazz's serial killer father, Billy. And his best friend Howie is bleeding to death on the floor of Jazz's own home in tiny Lobo's Nod. Somehow, these three must rise above the horrors their lives have become and find a way to come together in pursuit of Billy. But then Jazz crosses a line he's never crossed before, and soon the entire country is wondering: "Like father, like son?" Who is the true monster?<br>The chase is on, and beyond Billy there lurks something much, much worse. Prepare to meet...the Crow King.</p><p>Barry Lyga is the author of several acclaimed young adult novels, including <i>I Hunt Killers</i>, its sequel <i>Game</i>, and his debut, <i>The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl</i>. He now knows way too much about how to dispose of a human body. Barry lives and writes in New York City. His website is barrylyga.com.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;Jasper "Jazz" Dent is locked in a storage locker with two dead bodies, trying to nurse his own bullet wound in the dim light of a fading cellphone. Picking up (without pause) from the cliff-hanger ending in Game (2013), Lyga's series about the 17-year-old who was first introduced in I Hunt Killers (2012) as the son of escaped killer Billy Dent continues as he tries to aid the police in his father's recapture. Unaware that his girlfriend Connie has been lured by Billy to a Brooklyn tenement house and imprisoned with Jazz's mother, and that his hemophiliac friend, Howie, has been attacked, Jazz faces his demons alone&#x2014;including repressed memories with sexual undertones, and the creepy voice of Billy educating his son on the acumen required to be a good serial killer (appearing in italics). The worrisome genetic factor plagues Jazz yet propels him in the right direction to foil some copycat killers and elude authorities long enough to solve his own life's mysteries. Obstructing the law, the teen follows clues that take him back home to Lobo's Nod for the chilling climax and surprise ending, despite red herrings thrown in the readers' path at every turn. Connie and Howie continue to play major roles in this episode, often providing their own points of view, as do officers Hughes and Tanner as bumbling but likable authorities. As a trilogy wrap-up, this gory winner with raw appeal requires having read the first two titles.&#x2014;Vicki Reutter, State University of New York at Cortland</p><h2>Bodoni: Manual of Typography - Manuale tipografico (1818)</h2><p><strong>The birth of the legendary typeface:&nbsp;The complete reproduction of Bodoni's rare masterwork</strong> &nbsp; Celebrated printer and type designer&nbsp;<strong>Giambattista Bodoni</strong>&nbsp;set the standard for printing the alphabet with his&nbsp;<em>Manuale tipografico</em>&nbsp;(1818).

A lot more remains to be revealed. But enough has been found in the past few years to make it quite clear that the finest heart of the African world receded into the shadow while its broken bones were put on spectacular display. The image of the African, therefore, has been built up so far upon his lowest common denominator. In the new vision of the ancestor, we need to turn our eyes away from the periphery of the primitive to the more dynamic source of genius in the heartland of the African world. -- Ivan Van Sertima</p></p><p></p><h2>Man Overboard (An Ali Reynolds Novel)</h2><p>In the latest Ali Reynolds mystery from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author J.A.

Jance <br> <br>Prologue<br> <br>As the cruise ship rocked and rolled in open water, Roger McGeary stood in front of the mirror and tried for the fourteenth time to tie his damned bow tie. He had looked up the directions on the Internet and watched the demo through to the end, but that wasn&#x2019;t much help.<br> <br>He knew for sure it was his fourteenth attempt because that was something Roger always did&#x2014;always had to do&#x2014;he counted things. His arms ached. His hands shook. Beads of sweat had popped out on his brow, and the underarms of his freshly starched and pressed dress shirt were soaked through as well. A glance at the clock told him he was already ten minutes late to meet up with the girls in the bar for a predinner beverage.<br> <br>When the doorbell to his stateroom buzzed, he gave up, dropped the ends of the still untied tie, and pounded the dresser top in frustration. The blow sent one of his cuff links skittering across the polished wood surface and onto the carpeted floor, where it immediately disappeared from view under the bed. Roger was on his hands and knees searching for the missing cuff link when Reynaldo, his cabin butler, stuck his head around the doorjamb.<br> <br>&#x201c;Turndown service,&#x201d; he announced. &#x201c;Or would you rather I come back at another time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Roger muttered. &#x201c;Now&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I help you with something?&#x201d; Reynaldo asked solicitously.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost my damned cuff link, and I can&#x2019;t for the life of me tie my damned tie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Crouching at the foot of the bed, Reynaldo quickly retrieved the missing cuff link and dropped it into Roger&#x2019;s over-sized fist. Leaning on the bed, Roger heaved himself upright. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Appreciate it.&#x201d; And he did.<br> <br>&#x201c;As for the tie,&#x201d; Reynaldo offered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to help with that and with the cuff links as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>Feeling embarrassed and self-conscious at his own obvious incompetence, Roger surrendered himself to Reynaldo&#x2019;s ministrations. It took only a matter of seconds and a few deft movements on Reynaldo&#x2019;s part before the tie was properly tied.<br> <br>The butler stood back for a moment to admire his handiwork. &#x201c;Cuff links next,&#x201d; he said, and Roger handed them over. Once the cuff links were fastened, Reynaldo retrieved the jacket from the bed and held it up so Roger could slip into it. The jacket settled smoothly onto Roger&#x2019;s massive shoulders as though it had been made for him&#x2014;because it had. Aunt Julia had seen to that.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going on a cruise, Rog,&#x201d; she had told him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need a tux for formal nights on board, and by God you&#x2019;re going to have one.&#x201d; A lifetime&#x2019;s worth of experience had taught Roger that arguing with Aunt Julia was a losing proposition. He&#x2019;d gone straight out and ordered the tux. At Aunt Julia&#x2019;s urging he&#x2019;d also invested in a new sport coat and some big-and-tall dress shirts as well.<br> <br>&#x201c;After all,&#x201d; Aunt Julia had counseled, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a two-week cruise. You can&#x2019;t go down to the dining room in the same thing night after night.&#x201d;<br> <br>The big-and-tall shirts were necessary because Roger was a big man. Standing next to him, Reynaldo was tiny by comparison. Once the jacket was properly in place, the butler reached up and dusted off a tiny speck of lint before giving Roger an approving nod.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very good, sir,&#x201d; Reynaldo said. &#x201c;Take a look in the mirror.&#x201d;<br> <br>Turning back to face the mirror where he&#x2019;d spent the better part of forty-five minutes battling with the tie, Roger McGeary was startled to see the reflection staring back at him. He looked . . . well . . . good.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d never worn a tux before. Members of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Club back in high school weren&#x2019;t the kind of kids who went to proms or homecoming dances. And if they did somehow get around to getting married eventually, they didn&#x2019;t do so with a full contingent of bridesmaids and groomsmen. When there had been geeky weddings in Roger&#x2019;s circle of acquaintances, he himself had never been called upon to perform bridal party duties. And so, at the ripe old age of forty and a half, he was astonished to see that the tux made all the difference.<br> <br>Of course, his shoulder-length hair&#x2014;still mostly brown but beginning to go gray&#x2014;was maybe a bit incongruous with the tux, but it was too late to do anything about that now. Besides, Roger had worn his hair that way from the moment he turned twelve and realized that having a son with shoulder-length hair was something that drove his father nuts. Anything that bugged the hell out of James McGeary was exactly what his son would do.<br> <br>Roger grinned at Reynaldo. &#x201c;Thanks for your help,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mention it, sir,&#x201d; the butler replied, beginning the turndown process. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was something else his old D &amp; D pals would find �astonishing&#x2014;Roger McGeary on a cruise? In a stateroom with a damned butler? Get out!<br> <br>Feeling somewhat jaunty, Roger stopped long enough to pull his cell phone off the charger and slip it into his jacket pocket. Earlier when he&#x2019;d been looking for directions on the tie, he&#x2019;d noticed that the charge was lower than it should have been, and he&#x2019;d plugged it in while he was showering and shaving. If the phone was losing its ability to hold a charge, he&#x2019;d need to go looking for a new one once he got back home.<br> <br>Roger took the phone along with him to dinner more out of force of habit than because he was expecting calls. After all, he was on vacation, and his office in San Jose, California, was many time zones away. Letting himself out of the cabin, he started toward the elevator lobby. He&#x2019;d taken only a few steps when a sudden pitch sent him bouncing off first one wall and then the other.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s the English Channel, after all, he told himself. What do you expect?<br> <br>His stateroom was fairly well aft. As he tottered down the long corridor, he couldn&#x2019;t help thinking again of the kids he&#x2019;d hung out with back in high school. The only one he still stayed in touch with&#x2014;sometimes by text and occasionally by running into each other at cyber security conferences&#x2014;was Stu Ramey, the guy who had once been Roger&#x2019;s best friend. They had met up in Adams Junior High&#x2014;junior prison, as they called it.<br> <br>Smart, overweight, and both wearing glasses, Roger and Stu had bonded immediately. From junior high on, the nerdy outsiders had been bullied and disparagingly referred to by their classmates as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. That was in Phoenix, where at least he&#x2019;d had a friend or two. Once his mother pulled up stakes, moved Roger to L.A., and dumped him into the zoo that was Sepulveda High School for his senior year, he&#x2019;d had no friends at all, and he had been utterly lost.<br> <br>It was hardly surprising that Roger had never attended any of his high school class reunions. He&#x2019;d still been locked up in a mental health facility in Napa for his tenth. As for the twentieth? Thanks to Aunt Julia, he&#x2019;d been back on his feet by then and had actually received an invitation to the one in L.A., but he&#x2019;d had no interest in attending. He had no friends or happy memories from Sepulveda High, and he doubted anyone from back there remembered him, either. As for South Phoenix High? Kids who had come to the school via the special ed route hadn&#x2019;t exactly been welcomed with open arms. He supposed he could have crashed that reunion, but since his only friend at the time had been Stuart, there wasn&#x2019;t much point.<br> <br>As for Roger? Years of therapy hadn&#x2019;t completely fixed his self-esteem issues or his overweening insecurities, either, although seeing himself in the mirror in his tux was maybe further progress. And the next time he saw Stu, he&#x2019;d have to ask him about the reunion situation. Maybe Stuart Ramey had more balls than Roger did. Maybe he&#x2019;d gone back and braved the ravening horde&#x2014;arrogant jocks, perky cheerleaders, and all.<br> <br>In the elevator lobby, Roger stepped aside for a couple heading back the way he&#x2019;d come. The woman had a decidedly green cast to her skin, and she clung to her companion&#x2019;s arm with something close to a death grip. Roger thanked his lucky stars that he wasn&#x2019;t prone to motion sickness and wondered if any of the girls were, either.<br> <br>Calling his prospective dinner companions &#x201c;girls&#x201d; was a bit of a misnomer. For one thing, they were all north of sixty&#x2014;possibly even north of seventy&#x2014;but very well preserved. In the dining room the previous evening, the first night of the cruise, their four-top table had been next to his two-top by the window. As the wine flowed and plates of food came and went, they noticed that he was on his own. The next thing Roger knew, the three women had drawn him into conversation, asking where was he from, was he traveling solo, and what did he think of the cruise so far? By the time dinner was over, they had invited him to accompany them to the bar for an after-dinner drink, and before the evening ended&#x2014;sometime after midnight&#x2014;he had agreed to join them for the following night&#x2019;s formal dinner.<br> <br>Aunt Julia would have called them &#x201c;classy old broads.&#x201d; They were well dressed, well manicured, and no doubt well heeled. Roger had no doubt that the bits of jewelry on display were the real thing&#x2014;diamonds as opposed to zirconium. So, although he was happy to have been included in their circle, he knew he was completely out of his element.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t mention to them or to anyone else on board that the two-week cruise, complete with his two-room suite and an attending butler, was a freebie. Roger had detected and successfully prevented a massive data breach that would have thrown the cruise ship line into a nightmare and disrupted their entire reservations system. Not only had he preempted the attack, he&#x2019;d also managed to catch the culprit&#x2014;a disgruntled former employee. As far as Shining Star Cruises was concerned, Roger McGeary was a hero, and they were prepared to treat him as such.<br> <br>When Roger stepped off the elevator on deck five, he stood for a moment, staring in through the open doors of the ship&#x2019;s piano bar, the Starlight Lounge. The place was crowded. The girls&#x2014;Angie, Millie, and Dot&#x2014;had managed to snag seats at the bar and were evidently holding a spot for him. The barman, a cheerful guy named Xavier, caught Roger&#x2019;s eye as he stood in the entryway, nodded, and immediately turned to prepare Roger&#x2019;s preferred beverage&#x2014;Campari and soda&#x2014;which was poured and in position in front of the single open stool before Roger made it across the room.<br> <br>This was only the second night of the cruise, Roger noted, so how was it possible that Xavier recognized individual customers on sight and had already memorized their preferred beverages? Roger was entirely at home in the cyber world in front of keyboards and glowing computer screens, but Xavier&#x2019;s people skills&#x2014;his easy humor and pleasant gift of gab&#x2014;were completely absent from Roger&#x2019;s skill set. He&#x2019;d never be able to be a bartender, never in a million years.<br> <br>Dorothy Campbell, aka Dot, was a divorc�e with a thick southern accent. A little slip of a thing, with brightly hennaed red hair and a slick black sheath dress, she was also the self-proclaimed ringleader of the group. Dot launched herself off her stool and tackled Roger, greeting him with an enthusiastic hug.<br> <br>&#x201c;My goodness gracious,&#x201d; she said, looking him up and down. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t clean up nice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, thank you, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Roger replied, trying to match her accent with a sort of ersatz cowboy gallantry and then flushing in embarrassment because he felt like he&#x2019;d already made a jackass of himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not just having Campari and soda, are you?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you have something a little higher octane than that? How about joining us in a Kir Royale?&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what the girls had been drinking at the bar the previous night, and that&#x2019;s what they were having tonight as well. Roger wasn&#x2019;t much of a drinker, and he didn&#x2019;t do drugs, either&#x2014;any kind of drugs other than his doctor-prescribed antidepressants&#x2014;but he&#x2019;d allowed himself to be persuaded. Once he&#x2019;d made it back to the room the previous night, he&#x2019;d looked up &#x201c;Kir Royale,&#x201d; which turned out to be a heady combo of champagne and cr�me de cassis. Roger had attempted to tell them that he couldn&#x2019;t dance&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t dance. With a couple of Kir Royales under his belt, they had managed to cajole him onto the dance floor, sometimes with all three of them at once. By the time the girls had wished him good night, everybody had been flying high&#x2014;Roger included.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow,&#x201d; Dot had admonished him, shaking a finger in his face on her way out. &#x201c;Drinks in the bar at seven; dinner at seven-forty-five. Don&#x2019;t be late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Xavier had watched the three women leave the bar and head tipsily for the elevator. Shaking his head in mock sympathy, he turned to Roger. &#x201c;I believe you have your hands full, sir. Would you care for a refill?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Those were a little stiff for me,&#x201d; Roger had told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now in the predinner cocktail hour, canap�s came and went, and so did a second Campari and soda and finally a third. When seating at the bar proved too noisy for conversation, Dot commandeered a nearby table. In the ensuing conversation, Roger began to learn a bit about his companions. The three women were old college chums who had all attended Wellesley and had stayed friends through thick and thin ever since, including taking two-week cruises together each and every year.<br> <br>Roger didn&#x2019;t know exactly where Wellesley was, but he was pretty sure going there was a pricey proposition. And knowing how much the cruise cost on the open market, he estimated there had been a whole lot more thick in the women&#x2019;s lives than there had been thin. Dot had a cabin&#x2014;a Star Suite like his&#x2014;all to herself, while Angie and Millie bunked together in the next category down, a Veranda Stateroom. In the bar and again when they moved into the dining room, Roger listened to their harmless dinnertime chatter, feeling as though he was being given a window into another world, one he&#x2019;d never even imagined.<br> <br>Somewhere between courses three and four, between the mixed green salad and the pappardelle pasta, Roger came to the realization that these women had most likely been contemporaries of his late mother, may she rot in hell. Unlike Eloise McGeary, however, the girls actually seemed to like him.<br> <br>After the surf-and-turf main course&#x2014;prime rib and lobster&#x2014;and dessert&#x2014;a delectable flan topped with a layer of crisp caramel and three perfect raspberries&#x2014;Roger felt the buzz of an incoming text. But the wine had been flowing&#x2014;white followed by red&#x2014;and he was on vacation. If someone from work wanted to be in touch, they could damned well wait. And if it was Aunt Julia? Well, then, she could wait, too. It was afternoon in Payson, Arizona, and she&#x2019;d be out looking after her horses. Taking the phone out of his pocket but without bothering to look at the screen, he powered it off.<br> <br>Once dinner was over, the group migrated back to the bar, where a piano player accompanied a talented vocalist who sang everything from Patsy Cline to the Beatles. The passengers were mostly of an earlier vintage, Roger noted, and so was the music.<br> <br>A couple of hours went by, and more than a little booze passed Roger&#x2019;s lips, booze that was definitely of the high-octane variety. Halfway through his third Courvoisier, he realized that Millie and Angie had both disappeared from the picture, and he was left with an increasingly aggressive Dot, who was feeling him up in a most insistent and suggestive fashion. Roger was just drunk enough to find it laughable that this very spry older woman was hitting on him, but once she mentioned, not so coyly, that he was the &#x201c;only fresh meat&#x201d; to be found on board, it didn&#x2019;t seem ...</p><h2>Trust No One</h2><p><b>Following up on the incredible success of <i>River Road</i>, <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author Jayne Ann Krentz delivers another masterpiece of romantic suspense. </b><br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s no coincidence when Grace Elland finds a vodka bottle next to the lifeless body of her boss, motivational speaker Sprague Witherspoon.

His blue eyes, once so brilliant and compelling, were open. He stared sightlessly at the bedroom ceiling. A robust, square-jawed man with a mane of silver hair, he had always seemed larger-than-life. But death had shrunk him. All of the charm and electrifying charisma that had captivated the Witherspoon Way seminar audiences across the country had been drained away.</p><p>She was certain that he had been gone for several hours but she thought she detected a faint, accusing question in his unseeing eyes. Shattering memories splintered through her. At the age of sixteen she had seen the same question in the eyes of a dead woman. Why didn&#x2019;t you get here in time to save me?</p><p>She looked away from the dead eyes&#x2014;and saw the unopened bottle of vodka on the nightstand.</p><p>For a terrible moment past and present merged there in the bedroom. She heard the echo of heavy footsteps on old floorboards. Panic threatened to choke her. This could not be happening, not again. It&#x2019;s the old dream, she thought. You&#x2019;re in the middle of a nightmare but you&#x2019;re awake. Breathe. Focus, damn it, and breathe.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>The mantra broke the panic-induced trance. The echoing footsteps faded into the past. Ice-cold adrenaline splashed through her veins, bringing with it an intense clarity. This was not a dream. She was in a room with a dead man and, although she was almost certain that the footsteps had been summoned up from her nightmare, there was still the very real possibility that the killer was still around.</p><p>She grabbed the nearest available weapon&#x2014;the vodka bottle&#x2014;and moved to the doorway. There she paused to listen intently. The big house felt empty. Perhaps the footsteps had been an auditory illusion generated by the panicky memories. Or not. Either way, the smart thing to do was get out of the mansion and call 911.</p><p>She moved into the hallway, trying to make as little noise as possible. A fog of shadows darkened the big house. There were elegant potted plants everywhere&#x2014;vibrant green bamboo, palms and ferns. Sprague had firmly believed that the abundant foliage not only improved indoor air quality, but enhanced the positive energy in the atmosphere.</p><p>The curtains that covered the windows had been closed for the night. No one had been alive to draw them back that morning. Not that it would have done much good. The Seattle winter dawn had arrived with a low, overcast sky and now rain was tapping at the windows. On days like this, most people turned on a few lights.</p><p>No one rushed out of a doorway to confront her. Gripping the neck of the vodka bottle very tightly, she went down the broad staircase. When she reached the bottom, she flew across the grand living room.</p><p>She knew her way around the first floor of the house because Sprague Witherspoon had entertained lavishly and often. He always invited Grace and the other members of the Witherspoon Way staff to his catered affairs.</p><p>The vast great room had been furnished and decorated with those events in mind. The chairs, cushioned benches and tables were arranged in what designers called conversational groupings. There was a lot of expensive art on the walls.</p><p>Sprague Witherspoon had lived the lifestyle he had tried to teach in his seminars, and the motivational business had been good to him. With Sprague it had been all about positive thinking and an optimistic attitude.</p><p>But now someone had murdered him.</p><p>She whipped through the front door and out into the beautifully manicured gardens. She did not stop to pull up the hood of her jacket. By the time she reached her little compact waiting in the sweeping circular driveway her hair and face were soaked.</p><p>She got behind the wheel, locked all of the doors, put the vodka bottle on the floor and gunned the engine. She drove through the high steel gates that guarded the Queen Anne mansion and out onto the quiet residential street.</p><p>Once outside the grounds she brought the car to a halt and reached into her cross-body bag for her phone. It proved amazingly difficult to enter 911 because her hands were shaking so hard. When she finally got through to the operator she had to close her eyes in order to concentrate on getting the facts straight.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>&#x201c;Sprague Witherspoon is dead.&#x201d; She watched the big gates while she rattled off the address. &#x201c;At least, I think he&#x2019;s dead. I couldn&#x2019;t find a pulse. It looks like he&#x2019;s been shot. There is . . . a lot of blood.&#x201d;</p><p>More memories flashed through her head. A man with a face rendered into a bloody mask. Blood raining down on her. Blood everywhere.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anyone else in the house, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; The male operator&#x2019;s voice was sharp and urgent. &#x201c;Are you in danger?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. I&#x2019;m outside now. A few minutes ago I went in to check on Mr. Witherspoon because he didn&#x2019;t show up at the office this morning. The gates were open and the front door was unlocked. The alarm was off. I didn&#x2019;t think anything about it because I assumed he was out in the gardens. When I couldn&#x2019;t find him outside, I went into the house. I called out to him. When he didn&#x2019;t respond I worried that he had fallen or become ill. He lives alone, you see, and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Shut up, Grace. You&#x2019;re rambling. You must stay focused. You can have a panic attack later.</p><p>&#x201c;Stay outside,&#x201d; the operator said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got responders on the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, all right.&#x201d;</p><p>Grace ended the connection and listened to the sirens in the distance.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t until the first vehicle bearing the logo of the Seattle Police Department came to a stop in front of her car that she remembered a fact that everyone who watched television crime dramas knew well. When it came to suspects, cops always looked hard at the person who found the body.</p><p>She had a feeling that the investigators would look even more closely at a suspect who had a history of stumbling over dead bodies.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>She looked down at the bottle sitting on the floor of her car. Dread iced her blood.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t panic. A lot of people drink vodka.</p><p>But the only things she had ever seen Sprague drink were green tea and expensive white wine.</p><p>She found a tissue in her bag and used it to pick up the bottle. Not that it mattered much now. Her fingerprints were all over it.<br><br><b>Two</b></p><p>Isuppose the three of us can only be thankful that we&#x2019;ve all got reasonably good alibis,&#x201d; Millicent Chartwell said. She sank languidly against the back of the booth and regarded her martini with a forlorn expression. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t like the way that cute detective was watching me today when I gave my statement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t exactly smiling at me,&#x201d; Grace said. She took a sip of her white wine. &#x201c;In fact, if I weren&#x2019;t the optimistic type, I&#x2019;d say he was looking for an excuse to arrest me for Sprague&#x2019;s murder.&#x201d;</p><p>Kristy Forsyth put down her wineglass. Tears glittered in her eyes. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe Mr. Witherspoon is gone. I keep thinking there must have been a horrible case of mistaken identity and that he&#x2019;ll come striding through the door of the office tomorrow morning the way he always does, with some fresh-baked scones or doughnuts for us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was no mistake,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;I saw him. And Nyla Witherspoon identified her father&#x2019;s body. I was still at the house talking to the police when she arrived on the scene. She was seriously distraught. In tears. Shaky. Honestly, I thought she was going to faint.&#x201d;</p><p>It was just after five o&#x2019;clock. The three of them were exhausted and, Grace knew, still dazed. A close encounter with murder had an unnerving effect on most people. She and her office colleagues had not only lost a great boss, they had just lost their jobs. They were all of the opinion that working for the Witherspoon Way had been the best thing that had ever happened to them, career-wise. Their lives had been turned upside down by Sprague&#x2019;s murder.</p><p>After giving their statements, Millicent had suggested going for a drink. There was unanimous agreement. They were now seated in a booth in their favorite after-work spot, a cozy tavern and caf� near the Pike Place Market.</p><p>The day was ending the way it had begun, with rain and gloom. The winter solstice had passed a few weeks earlier. The days were becoming perceptibly longer&#x2014;Seattleites were keen observers of the nuances in the ever-changing patterns of sunlight&#x2014;but the early evening twilight made it seem as if it was still December on the calendar.</p><p>Millicent sipped her martini and narrowed her eyes. &#x201c;If I were the police, the first suspect on my list would be Nyla Witherspoon.&#x201d;</p><p>As Sprague&#x2019;s bookkeeper and financial manager, Millicent had a tendency to go straight to the bottom line, regardless of the subject. She was a vivacious, curvy redhead with a taste for martinis and the occasional bar hookup.</p><p>Millicent had been working for Sprague for nearly a year before Grace had joined the Witherspoon Way team. On the surface, she seemed to have it all&#x2014;film star&#x2013;level glamour and a computer for a brain. She had used both to make her way in the world. What Millicent did not have was a family. Her past was murky. She did not like to discuss it. But she had once said that she left home at the age of sixteen and had no intention of ever returning. She was a survivor. In spite of the odds against her, she had landed adroitly on her stiletto heels.</p><p>Kristy blinked away a few more tears. &#x201c;Nyla does have the most to gain from Sprague&#x2019;s death, doesn&#x2019;t she? But she&#x2019;s his daughter, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. We all know that she had issues with him. It was a troubled relationship. Still, murdering her father?&#x201d;</p><p>Kristy was the most recent member of the Witherspoon team. Born and raised in a small town in Idaho, she had moved to Seattle in search of adventure and&#x2014;as she had explained to Grace and Millicent&#x2014;more options in husbands. With her light brown hair, warm eyes and pretty features, she was attractive in a sweet, wholesome way that went down well with the Witherspoon clients.</p><p>Unlike Millicent, Kristy was close to her family. Although she had confided to her coworkers that she did not want to marry a farmer, it was clear that she had a deep and abiding affection for the bucolic world she had left behind. She was forever regaling the office staff with humorous stories about growing up on a farm.</p><p>Grace and Millicent had privately speculated that Sprague had felt sorry for Kristy, who had found herself struggling in the big city. Perhaps giving her a job had been, in part, an act of kindness back at the beginning. But somewhat to everyone&#x2019;s amazement, Kristy had quickly displayed an invaluable flair for travel logistics and an ability to charm clients. As the demand for Witherspoon Way seminars had grown, so had the work involved in coordinating Sprague&#x2019;s busy schedule. Business had been so brisk lately that Sprague had been on the verge of hiring an assistant for Kristy.</p><p>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time an heir has hurried things along,&#x201d; Millicent pointed out. &#x201c;Besides, we know that Nyla was furious with Sprague. They argued constantly. Things between them only got worse when Mr. Perfect came along. Sprague didn&#x2019;t approve of him and that just made Nyla angrier. I think she was ready to do just about anything to get her hands on her inheritance. She hated Sprague for putting her on an allowance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, she is an adult, not a child,&#x201d; Grace pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;If you ask me, she decided she didn&#x2019;t want to wait any longer for the money,&#x201d; Millicent said. She swallowed some more of her martini, lowered the glass and fixed Grace and Kristy with a grim expression. &#x201c;I think there&#x2019;s something else we should keep in mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Kristy frowned. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>Millicent plucked the little plastic spear out of the martini and munched the olive. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true that Nyla had issues with her father but she wasn&#x2019;t very fond of the three of us, either. We had better watch our backs.&#x201d;</p><p>Kristy&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Jeez, you&#x2019;re serious, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah,&#x201d; Millicent said.</p><p>Grace picked up her glass and took a sip. The wine was starting to soften the edgy sensation that had been riding her hard all day but she knew from experience that the effects would not last. She told herself to think positive but she had a bad feeling that the old dream would return that night.</p><p>She studied Millicent. &#x201c;Do you really think Nyla is a threat?&#x201d;</p><p>Millicent shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying it would be a good idea to be careful for a while. I&#x2019;m telling you, Nyla Witherspoon is unstable. She and Sprague had what can only be called a fraught relationship but the capper was the new fianc�.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Burke Marrick,&#x201d; Kristy said. She made a face. &#x201c;AKA Mr. Perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; Millicent said. &#x201c;Burke Marrick was Sprague&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Sprague was always worried that some good-looking, fast-talking con man would come along and sweep Nyla off her feet. Why do you think Sprague insisted on paying her bills and keeping her on an allowance? He was trying to protect her.&#x201d;</p><p>Kristy sniffed. &#x201c;Small countries could live on Nyla&#x2019;s allowance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The actual amount is beside the point.&#x201d; Millicent aimed the olive spear at Kristy. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s one thing I know, it&#x2019;s money, and I know how people react to it. Trust me, no one ever thinks they have enough. Nyla couldn&#x2019;t stand the thought that the bulk of her inheritance was tied up in a special trust that she could not access until her father&#x2019;s death. And I&#x2019;ve got a hunch Mr. Perfect was pushing her hard to get ahold of the money.&#x201d;</p><p>A grim silence settled on the table. Grace reflected on the fact that they had all had their run-ins with Sprague&#x2019;s temperamental daughter. Nyla had seemed jealous of the three of them. Now she would have her inheritance to go with her charming fianc�. From a certain perspective, life was suddenly looking quite rosy for Nyla. And for Mr. Perfect.</p><p>Grace cleared her throat. &#x201c;You do realize what you&#x2019;re saying, Millicent. If you&#x2019;re right, that means that Burke Marrick is also a suspect.&#x201d;</p><p>Kristy put her glass down very quickly. &#x201c;What if Nyla and Burke planned Sprague&#x2019;s murder together?&#x201d;</p><p>Millicent shrugged. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think we had better hold off on the conspiracy theories,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to make a list of suspects, you&#x2019;ll need a really big sheet of paper.&#x201d;</p><p>Kristy and Millicent looked at her.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Kristy asked. &#x201c;Sprague was so nice. So generous.&#x201d;</p><p>Understanding gleamed in Millicent&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, Grace. After Nyla and Marrick, the next name on the list just has to be Larson Rayner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We all know there was not a lot of positive energy lost between Larson and Sprague,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;Nothing like a falling-out between business partners to create motive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Kristy said. &#x201c;Remember how Larson stormed into the office last month and accused Sprague of stealing his clients?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Professional envy and a strong dose of jealousy, not to mention a decline in revenues.&#x201d; Millicent smiled. Her green eyes gleamed. &#x201c;Great motives for murder.&#x201d; She lo...</p></p><h2>The Development of American Citizenship, 1608-1870 (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>he concept of citizenship that achieved full legal form and force in mid-nineteenth-century America had English roots in the sense that it was the product of a theoretical and legal development that extended over three hundred years. This prize-winning volume describes and explains the process by which the cirumstances of life in the New World transformed the quasi-medieval ideas of seventeenth-century English jurists about subjectship, community, sovereignty, and allegiance into a wholly new doctrine of "volitional allegiance."<br><br>The central British idea was that subjectship involved a personal relationship with the king, a relationship based upon the laws of nature and hence perpetual and immutable. The conceptual analogue of the subject-king relationship was the natural bond between parent and child.<br><br>Across the Atlantic divergent ideas were taking hold. Colonial societies adopted naturalization policies that were suited to practical needs, regardless of doctrinal consistency. Americans continued to value their status as subjects and to affirm their allegiance to the king, but they also moved toward a new understanding of the ties that bind individuals to the community. English judges of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries assumed that the essential purpose of naturalization was to make the alien legally the same as a native, that is, to make his allegiance natural, personal, and perpetual. In the colonies this reasoning was being reversed. Americans took the model of naturalization as their starting point for defining all political allegiance as the result of a legal contract resting on consent.<br><br>This as yet barely articulated difference between the American and English definition of citizenship was formulated with precision in the course of the American Revolution. Amidst the conflict and confusion of that time Americans sought to define principles of membership that adequately encompassed their ideals of individual liberty and community security. The idea that all obligation rested on individual volition and consent shaped their response to the claims of Parliament and king, legitimized their withdrawal from the British empire, controlled their reaction to the loyalists, and underwrote their creation of independent governments.<br><br>This new concept of citizenship left many questions unanswered, however. The newly emergent principles clashed with deep-seated prejudices, including the traditional exclusion of Indians and Negroes from membership in the sovereign community. It was only the triumph of the Union in the Civil War that allowed Congress to affirm the quality of native and naturalized citizens, to state unequivocally the primacy of the national over state citizenship, to write black citizenship into the Constitution, and to recognize the volitional character of, the status of citizen by formally adopting the principle of expatriation.--&gt;<br><br></p><p>"Kettner explores this complex but fascinating subject with authority and dexterity.

After a resounding electoral triumph in 1906, the Liberals formed the government of the most powerful nation on earth, yet within a few years the House of Lords lost its absolute veto over legislation, the Home Rule crisis brought Ireland to the brink of civil war and led to an army mutiny, the campaign for woman&#x2019;s suffrage created widespread civil disorder and discredited the legal and penal systems, and an unprecedented wave of strikes swept the land.<br>This is a classic account, first published in 1935, of the dramatic upheaval and political change that overwhelmed England in the period 1910-1914. Few books of history retain their relevance and vitality after more than sixty years. The Strange Death of Liberal England is one of the most important books of the English past, a prime example that history can be abiding literature. As a portrait of England enmeshed in the turbulence of new movements, which often led to violence against the pieties of Liberal England&#x2014;until it was overwhelmed by the greatest violence of all, World War I&#x2014;this extraordinary book has continued to exert a powerful influence on the way historians have observed early twentieth-century England.<br><br>&#x201c;The book is as vital, if not more so, as when it was first published. . . . While hundreds of academic monographs have been forgotten, The Strange Death of Liberal England continues as a major influence on how the period is viewed, and scholars and teachers spend considerable energy in coming to terms with the picture of England, in all its richness and complexity, presented in the book. . . . The interpretation will not die; no matter how often it may be knocked on the head, it has shaped the way the period is viewed. With its extraordinary literate and witty prose, its power of description and analysis . . . it is a study that will always have to be taken into account. There can be few works that are so alive after so many years, as likely to survive, or as enjoyable to read.&#x201d; &#x2014;From the Foreword</p><h2>Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success</h2><p><p>In the summer of 2015, as he vaulted to the lead among the many GOP candidates for president, Donald Trump was the only one dogged by questions about his true intentions. This most famous American businessman had played the role of provocateur so often that pundits, reporters, and voters struggled to believe that he was a serious contender. Trump stirred so much controversy that his candidacy puzzled anyone who applied ordinary political logic to the race. But as Michael D'Antonio shows in <i>Never Enough</i>, Trump has rarely been ordinary in his pursuit of success and his trademark method is based on a logic that begins with his firm belief that he is a singular and superior human being.</p><p>As revealed in this landmark biography, Donald Trump is a man whose appetite for wealth, attention, power, and conquest is practically insatiable. Declaring that he is still the person he was as a rascally little boy, Trump confesses that he avoids reflecting on himself "because I might not like what I see" and he believes "most people aren't worthy of respect."</p><p>A product of the media age and the Me Generation that emerged in the 1970s, Trump was a Broadway showman before he became a developer. Mentored by the scoundrel attorney Roy Cohn, Trump was a regular on the New York club scene and won press attention as a dashing young mogul before he had built his first major project. He leveraged his father's enormous fortune and political connections to get his business off the ground, and soon developed a larger-than-life persona. In time, and through many setbacks, he made himself into a living symbol of extravagance and achievement. </p><p>Drawing upon extensive and exclusive interviews with Trump and many of his family members, including all his adult children, D'Antonio presents the full story of a truly American icon, from his beginnings as a businessman to his stormy romantic life and his pursuit of power in its many forms. For all those who wonder: Just who is Donald Trump?,<i> Never Enough</i> supplies the answer. He is a promoter, builder, performer and politician who pursues success with a drive that borders on obsession and yet, has given him, almost everything he ever wanted.</p></p><p>As part of a team of journalists from <i>Newsday</i>, MICHAEL D'ANTONIO won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting before going on to write many acclaimed books, including biographies of Milton S. Hershey and Sir Thomas Lipton. His book, <i>Mortal Sins,</i> was praised by Booklist as "a landmark work of recent history [which] remains gripping and affecting to the last word." He has also written for <i>Esquire</i>, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.<p>&#x201c;<i>Never Enough</i> is an admirably straight�forward, evenhanded but nonetheless damning account of Trump&#x2019;s life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;A brisk and entertaining read, drawing on interviews and documents and distilling decades&#x2019; worth of news coverage to tell the story of Trump&#x2019;s childhood, family, business deals and political forays.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;A carefully reported and fair-minded account. ... [D&#x2019;Antonio] has pulled together Trump's story, subjected it to some fact-checking and dissected a string of business deals that display his drive to win, his thirst for money, his willingness to push boundaries and his apparently endless quest for publicity.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>USA Today</i></p><p>"Delightful." &#x2015;<i>London Review of Books</i></p><p>"Balanced, well-sourced and perfectly timed." &#x2015;<i>The Financial Times</i></p></p><h2>Stanzaic Guy of Warwick (Middle English Texts)</h2><p>The poem, which survives only in the Auchinleck Manuscript, deals with the later years of Guy&#39;s life, beginning with his return to Warwick after having established himself on the Continent as a pre-eminent model of knighthood. After his marriage, however, he is stricken by remorse for the very actions that have brought him fame, and he sets out anonymously on a series of pilgrimages of atonement.</p><p>Alison Wiggins is senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Glasgow.

Evslin's language is both earthy and poetic; his retelling of the Cyclopes myth(s) is compelling and dramatic, from the birth of the monsters to Gaia, ``whose name means earth,'' to the blinding of Polyphemus by Ulysses. Beautifully detailed and carefully designed (each chapter begins with an initial letter rubric that draws on mythological motifs), this is a heavily illustrated book, with over 40 reproductions of fine art masterpieces (i.e., Goya, Renoir, Cellini) in color and black and white. Evslin's accessible and exhilarating writing style makes this an eminently successful combination of art and text. Given the strong demand for and high interest in the subject, as well as the high quality of this presentation, this is an outstanding addition to any mythology collection, easily booktalked and highly motivational for both reluctant and avid readers.

With Adam Victor&#39;s astute research and crisp writing, as well as hundreds of photographs (including shots by top photographers Eve Arnold, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Milton Greene, among others), the facts of Marilyn&#39;s amazing life are represented in full and, of course, there is complete information on Marilyn&#39;s lovers, songs, and films, including credit listings. The Marilyn Encyclopedia is the second-to-none resource on Marilyn Monroe.</p><p><i>The Marilyn Encyclopedia</i> is, according to its jacket notes, "the most comprehensive book about [Marilyn Monroe's] extraordinary life and legacy ever published." This may easily be true--it is incredibly, insanely detailed. Author Adam Victor has taken every conceivable source of Marilyn information--admittedly including Internet rumors and Hollywood gossip among the more well-documented tidbits--distilled them down to alphabetical entries, and cross-referenced them to within an inch of their lives. While the casual fan can check out Marilyn's <i>Look</i> covers or a list of the screenwriters she worked with, hardcore devotees can look up such vital information as the name of the first restaurant she and Joe DiMaggio ate at on their honeymoon (a controversy--was it the restaurant at the Hot Springs Hotel or at the Clifton Inn?) or the name of Marilyn's poodle (Maf Honey). The meticulous cross-referencing makes <i>The Marilyn Encyclopedia</i> an extremely enjoyable browser's read, allowing the reader to hop from Marilyn's disdain for underwear to her working relationship with John Huston to the fact that she never had much trouble with gambling--all with the flip of a page. This encyclopedia of course contains a rich assortment of photos: posed studio portraits, pinups, and candid shots vie for space throughout the tome. Despite his obvious devotion as a fan, Victor is remarkably evenhanded in his choice of the quotes and anecdotes sprinkled throughout the book. The reader cannot help but be left with the impression that, for all her magical appeal, Monroe may well have been a trying person to deal with on a day-to-day basis. This is the perfect book for the dedicated fan who wants to know everything--no, really, everything--about Marilyn Monroe. <i>--Ali Davis</i>Adam Victor is a writer and translator. The Marilyn Encyclopedia, now published in six countries, is his biggest project to date. Victor appeared in and was a consultant on the E!

Why do we forget? And what, exactly, is a memory?</p><p>With playfulness and intelligence, Adventures in Memory answers these questions and more, offering an illuminating look at one of our most fascinating faculties. The authors&#x2014;two Norwegian sisters, one a neuropsychologist and the other an acclaimed writer&#x2014;skillfully interweave history, research, and exceptional personal stories, taking readers on a captivating exploration of the evolving understanding of the science of memory from the Renaissance discovery of the hippocampus&#x2014;named after the seahorse it resembles&#x2014;up to the present day. Mixing metaphor with meta-analysis, they embark on an incredible journey: &#x201c;diving for seahorses&#x201d; for a memory experiment in Oslo fjord, racing taxis through London, and &#x201c;time-traveling&#x201d; to the future to reveal thought-provoking insights into remembering and forgetting. Along the way they interview experts of all stripes, from the world&#x2019;s top neuroscientists to famous novelists, to help explain how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what we can do to improve it.</p><p>Filled with cutting-edge research and nimble storytelling, the result is a charming&#x2014;and memorable&#x2014;adventure through human memory.</p></p><p><p>"An accessible book, which makes it all the more joyful." <br><strong>&#x2014;NYLON</strong></p><br><br><p>"There are many reasons to read this book, not least because it is fascinating to the point of being slightly disturbing."<strong><br>&#x2014;The Times</strong></p><br><br><p>"Takes the reader on a tour of the past 450 years of memory research."<strong><br>&#x2014;The Lancet, Neurology</strong></p><br><br><p>"Hilde and Ylva �stby are well aware that they are working close to the core of human identity and that is complex terrain.

It simply files things away. It keeps things for you, or hides things from you&#x2014;and summons them to your recall with a will of its own. You think you have a memory; but it has you!</em>&#x2014;John Irving, <em>A Prayer for Owen Meany</em></p><br><br><p>At the bottom of the ocean, tail curled around seagrass, the male seahorse sways back and forth in the current. He may be tiny and mysterious, but no ocean creature compares to him. The only male in the animal kingdom to become pregnant, he stands on guard, carrying his eggs in his pouch until they hatch and the fry swim away into the open sea.</p><br><br><p>But let&#x2019;s back up: this isn&#x2019;t a book about seahorses. To find our real subject, we must rise out of the depths and journey back 450 years.</p><br><br><p>The year is 1564. We&#x2019;re in Bologna, Italy, a city full of elegant brick buildings and shady, vine-covered walkways. Here, at the world&#x2019;s first proper university, Dr. Julius Caesar Arantius bends over a beautiful object. Well, beautiful might be an exaggeration, if you&#x2019;re not already deeply, passionately involved in its study. It&#x2019;s a human brain. Rather gray and unassuming, and on loan from a nearby mortuary. Students surround the doctor, clustered on benches throughout the theater, following his work intently, as though he and the organ in front of him are the two leads in a drama. Arantius leans over the brain and slices through its outer layers, studying each fraction of an inch with extreme interest, hoping to understand what it does. His disregard for religious authority is clear in the gusto with which he approaches his dissection because, at the time, the scientific study of human corpses is strictly forbidden.</p><br><br><p>The doctor cuts further into the object, examining what&#x2019;s inside. And then, deep within the brain, buried in the temporal lobe, he finds something very interesting. Something small, curled up into itself. It looks, he thinks, a bit like a silkworm. The upper classes of the Italian Renaissance loved silk, a luxurious and exotic fabric that arrived in Venice via the Silk Road from China; by extension, they loved silkworms too. Intrigued, Arantius looks closer, making some careful cuts, and pries the little worm loose, liberating it from the rest of the brain.</p><br><br><p>This is the moment at which modern memory research was born, the precise moment that memory, as a concept, moved from the mythological world into the physical one. However, back then, on that particular day in sixteenth-century Bologna, life goes on in the markets as usual; people carry wine and truffles and pasta below the city&#x2019;s famous pergolas and ancient red brick towers, oblivious to the hugely important discovery in their midst.</p><br><br><p>Arantius turns over what he has dug out of the brain and places it on the table before him, considering what it might be. That&#x2019;s it! Rather than a silkworm, perhaps it is a tiny seahorse? Yes, indeed. With its head nodding forward and its tail curling up, it does look like a seahorse, the tiny distinctive fish living in shallow ocean waters between the tropics and England. And so he names it: hippocampus, meaning &#x201c;horse sea monster&#x201d; in Latin. It also shares its name with a mythological creature&#x2014;half horse, half fish&#x2014;said to wreak havoc in the waters around ancient Greece.</p><br><br><p>By the light of a tallow candle perched on an autopsy table, Julius Caesar Arantius couldn&#x2019;t tell what this little part of the brain actually did. All he could do was give it a name. Hundreds of years passed before we fully understood the significance of what this Italian doctor held in his hands, and you might guess that it has something to do with memory. After all, memory is the subject of this book.</p><br><br><p>The world beneath the sea and the one in our brain are profoundly different, of course, but there are many similarities between the seahorse and the hippocampus. Just as the male seahorse carries his eggs in his pouch until it&#x2019;s safe for the fry to be on their own, the seahorse of the brain also carries something: our memories. It watches over them and nurtures them until they are strong enough to make it on their own. The hippocampus is the womb that carries our memories.</p><br><br><p>No one knew how crucial the hippocampus was to memory until 1953, but there was endless speculation about where memories were stored in the brain. One popular early belief was that our thoughts flowed through the liquid inside our skulls, but that theory was long gone by 1953. By then, the prevailing thought was that memories were created and stored throughout the brain. But then something happened to sink this theory once and for all, an incident that was tragic for one man, fortunate for the rest of us. An unsuccessful experimental surgery was the key to understanding Julius Caesar Arantius&#x2019;s earlier discovery.</p></p><h2>Screenwriting Updated: New (And Conventional) Ways of Writing for the Screen</h2><p>Today&#39;s screenwriter must be adept at today&#39;s popular yet often complex and unconventional script forms, such as the parallel storytelling of Pulp Fiction and Magnolia, the multiple protagonist narrative of American Beauty, and the complex flashback forms of The Usual Suspects and The Sweet Hereafter. Becoming comfortable with and skilled in such modern script forms is the focus of Screenwriting Updated, which identifies basic parallel structures, clearly explains how and why they work (or fail to work), and establishes the basic principles of their construction. These modern forms are presented in tandem with and in relation to tried-and-true, traditional screenwriting forms, rendering unconventional structures as easily grasped as conventional ones. Unlike any other screenwriting book, Screenwriting Updated combines solid, basic screenwriting craft with a thorough presentation of very contemporary script structures. The result is a unique, wide-ranging, in-depth screenwriting text and do-it-yourself script-doctoring manual suitable for both seasoned and novice writers.</p><p>Linda Aronson<br>Linda Aronson has won awards as scriptwriter, playwright and novelist.

First of all: it&#x2019;s called <em>The Girls</em> for a reason; While this mesmerizing debut does involve a charismatic Mansonesque leader in California in the late 1960s, it is more focused on the girls in his cult, the ones who enthrall 14 year old Evie Boyd, a self-conscious child of divorce, privilege and malaise. The tale of the girls and the cult and the ultimate violence they commit is told by Evie, now a middle aged woman with regrets. Some of the parallels Cline tries to draw between the teenaged Evie&#x2019;s rage and that of some current young people in her life can be strained but Cline&#x2019;s observations are preternaturally mature and her writing strong. (A character the girls are attempting to rob lies &#x201c;on her kitchen floor, calling my name like a right answer.&#x201d;) The subject matter may be familiar--and I don&#x2019;t just mean Manson, I mean the way teenagers can be terrified and terrifying all at once--Cline&#x2019;s <em>The Girls</em> is surprisingly timeless and perfectly creepy. <em>--Sara Nelson, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Emma Cline</b> was the winner of <i>The Paris Review</i>&#x2019;s Plimpton Prize in 2014.

JonPaul is a health nut.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; I tilted my head toward Tina&#x2019;s table.<br><br>&#x201c;The new kid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What new kid?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cash Devine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s his actual name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the fakest thing I ever heard.&#x201d;<br><br>JonPaul shrugged and swallowed a handful of vitamins with his soy milk.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know him?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in my math class.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doing at Tina&#x2019;s table?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She was assigned to show him around school, help get him familiar with everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since when did a welcome guide become standard operating procedure around here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I dunno. Are those organic grapes in your lunch? And if they are, can I have them? I haven&#x2019;t been getting enough fiber lately and the skins would really help me out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I shoved what I knew to be run-�of-�the-�mill produce reeking of pesticides toward him as fast as I could, trying to avoid a conversation about what happens to JonPaul&#x2019;s digestive tract when he&#x2019;s fiber-�deprived. Been there, done that, have the horrible mental images.<br><br>He lined up the grapes next to his baby car- rots, Greek yogurt, hardboiled eggs and stone-�ground gluten-�free crackers. I ate a handful of chocolate-�covered potato chips while I studied Tina and the Threat.<br><br>Cash caught me looking at him when Tina turned to talk to the girl on her other side, and he headed toward me, a big cheesy grin on his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Cash. Cash Devine. Good to know you.&#x201d;<br><br>He sounded like the politicians at the Labor Day parade who hand out mini-�flags and ask for your support on Election Day.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I grunted back. &#x201c;Name&#x2019;s Kevin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;JonPaul,&#x201d; he said, slapping my best friend on the back, &#x201c;math is gonna be rough, buddy; hope I can count on you for some help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know if my guide, Tina, has a boyfriend? She&#x2019;s really hot.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t hear JonPaul&#x2019;s reply; I saw his lips moving, but the pressure in my ears from my brain freak-�out deafened me.<br><br>No.<br><br>No way.<br><br>No flipping way.<br><br>That plastic-�looking, fake-�named, phony-� friendly doofus wasn&#x2019;t going to waltz into my school and take my girlfriend away from me. Especially when I hadn&#x2019;t had the chance to make her my girlfriend yet.<br><br>I had to get away from Cash before I did something embarrassing, like slug him or watch my head explode all over JonPaul&#x2019;s surgeon general&#x2013;�approved lunch. I mumbled some excuse about getting a homework assignment and bailed.<br><br>I saw my friends Katie and Connie and made a beeline for their table. Okay, I&#x2019;m stretching things a bit calling them friends. I think Connie likes me just fine, but I&#x2019;m not sure she trusts me. I am positive Katie neither likes nor trusts me. We have a history. It&#x2019;s a long story and I look bad at the end. But that didn&#x2019;t stop me.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, mind if I sit with you two?&#x201d; I said with what I was sure was the furthest thing from the phony smile Cash had given me. I&#x2019;d practiced in the mirror. Smiles that are both big and genuine take effort, and I&#x2019;d wanted to make sure that when I finally got around to talking to Tina, I had the right look on my face. Friendly, but not frantic. Confident, but not smug. It takes work to hit that perfect balance.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Connie moved her books so I could sit across from them. Katie said nothing, but at least she didn&#x2019;t dump her enchilada on my lap. I took that as progress.<br><br>&#x201c;I need a woman&#x2019;s point of view,&#x201d; I told them.<br><br>Connie blushed. Katie glared at me.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you met the new guy?&#x201d; I rolled my eyes in Cash&#x2019;s direction. Connie blushed deeper and Katie nodded. &#x201c;What do you think of him, guy-�wise? I mean, is he the kind of guy who rocks your world?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Katie asked, suspicion oozing from every pore of her body.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m interested in learning what girls find attractive. Especially girls like you.&#x201d; Flattery is a good technique for getting information from someone.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Katie looked confused. She hasn&#x2019;t been uncertain about anything since before potty training, so I felt a tiny thrill at bamboozling her.<br><br>Connie looked thoughtful. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s very good-� looking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Girls like that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure, but it&#x2019;s not everything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What else do you look for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Personality.&#x201d; Katie was staring at me with an odd expression that I couldn&#x2019;t understand, but I liked her answer; I am Mr. Personality.<br><br>&#x201c;Cool. What&#x2014;�&#x201d; The bell rang before I could ask any more questions, and everyone started hurrying out of the cafeteria. I watched Tina and Cash walk down the hall together as I headed toward my next class.<br><br>Clearly, I&#x2019;d been panicking in the clutch just because I didn&#x2019;t have enough information about romance. Once I collected enough data, I&#x2019;d make Tina forget all about that guy and his straight teeth and perfect hair and big shoulders.<br><br>I just had to figure out how to figure out girls.<br><br>Guys have been getting girls to fall in love with them for millions of years. My only problem was that I&#x2019;d never applied myself before. But that was about to change.

These words, spoken by prize-winning author Studs Terkel, are a fitting lens through which to view the work of <i>Milton Rogovin</i>, optometrist, political activist, and photographer. <i>Milton Rogovin: The Making of a Social Documentary Photographer</i> chronicles the story behind that life, and the man behind the acclaimed photographs that invite us to see for the first time, or to see anew, the tenacity, profound dignity, and resilience of people living in extremely difficult circumstances.<br><br>Born in New York in 1909 to a Russian Jewish immigrant family, Rogovin was radicalized by the widespread deprivations he witnessed and experienced during the Depression, and he dedicated himself to working for social and economic justice. After military service in World War II, he began an optometry practice in Buffalo, and he and his wife became active politically, engaging in union organizing and voter registration in Buffalo's African-American community. His activism led him to be called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, and after refusing to testify, he was dubbed "Buffalo's Number One Communist." Much of his optometry clientele vanished, but, as he would realize, "there was also a positive result" to the attacks. His political voice silenced, he turned to photography as a way to speak about social inequities.<br><br>In the years that have followed, Rogovin has devoted himself to chronicling the lives of people in New York, Appalachia, Scotland, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Mexico, France, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Germany, and China. Scholar Melanie Herzog locates Rogovin within a tradition of social documentary photography that began when nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century sociologists took up the camera, or, more often, enlisted the service of photographers to advocate for social reform through visual representations of the plight of the poor. But while Rogovin's work is undoubtedly political, he does not romanticize his subjects or seek to portray them as victims or heroes; he seeks simply to convey the effects of material reality on people and their agency, to show how people live in relation to social conditions.<br><br>This richly illustrated retrospective features Rogovin's own narrative of his development and life as a documentary photographer, amplified by an account of the historical events and circumstances that shaped his politics and social consciousness. <i>Milton Rogovin</i> has dedicated his life's work-as an optometrist, an activist, and a photographer-to enabling people to see more clearly.

Originating in their modern printed form in 16th-century Germany, where books were highly valuable and treasured, bookplates became an art form practiced by artists across Europe and beyond. This book traces the fascinating evolution of bookplate design over time and across national boundaries, showcasing 100 key examples of <i>ex libris</i> art.</p><p>In the early 1500s, Albrecht D�rer and other German engravers and printmakers began to create highly decorative bookplates, often featuring armorial devices and coats of arms for wealthy individuals and institutions. As the fashion for ornamental bookplates spread, distinctive national styles evolved. Nearly every conceivable design element&#x2014;from cupids to scientific instruments, portraits, and landscapes&#x2014;served to decorate personal bookplates. This volume explores the various sources of <i>ex libris</i> inspiration, including designs by C. R. Ashbee, Walter Crane, Aubrey Beardsley, Eric Gill, and Rudyard Kipling, as seen in the books of Frederic Leighton, Calvin Coolidge, and many others.

Matt (Matilda) Black, one of the two main characters in <i>A Red Heart of Memories</i>, appeared in two previous Hoffman novellas: <i>Unmasking</i> and <i>Home for Christmas</i>. Matt is a wanderer with the power to speak to inanimate objects and watch other people's thoughts and dreams. She meets a wandering witch, Edmund Reynolds. "Mostly I just wander from one place to the next," said Edmund, "waiting to be needed for something, then trying to figure out what it is." Spirit tells Edmund he can help Matt, even if she doesn't want him hanging around, and Matt finds that she can help Edmund in return.<p> Hoffman's fantasy is very much in the spirit of Jonathan Carroll's <i>The Marriage of Sticks</i> and Peter S.

They're sophisticated, well-crafted stories written in a distinctive, uncynical voice and filled with magical reality.</p><p> In 1994, Hoffman won the Bram Stoker First Novel Award for <i>The Thread That Binds the Bones</i>, and both <i>The Silent Strength of Stones</i> (1995) and <i>A Red Heart of Memories</i> were nominated for the World Fantasy Award.

This discovery enables the two men to set off on a fantastic journey to the Moon. But they are not prepared for what they find there - a world of freezing nights, boiling days and danger from a sinister alien lifeform, the selenites, creatures who have developed an intricate hierarchical society beneath the lunar surface. <br> <i>The First Men in the Moon</i> ignited speculation in nineteenth century society concerning what lies on and beneath the surface of the Moon. By turns amusing, thrilling and stimulating, the novel is a classic of its genre.<br> This volume also contains another of Wells's fascinating thought-provoking fantasies: <i>A Modern Utopia</i> in which two travellers fall into a space-warp and find themselves upon a Utopian Earth controlled by a single World Government.<br></p><p>The First Men in the Moon (1901) is one of the most dazzling of Wells&#39;s &#39;scientific romances, &#39; and the last of the series which began with The Time Machine. Leaving their humdrum lives in Kent, Mr. Bedford and Mr. Cavor invade the moon and are captured by the ant-like Selenites. They are forced to confront their own littleness when viewed in a cosmic perspective, and the result is a highly entertaining satire on imperialism in particular and human frailty in general.Often called the father of science fiction, British author Herbert George (H. G.) Wells literary works are notable for being some of the first titles of the science fiction genre, and include such famed titles as The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Island of Doctor Moreau, and The Invisible Man. Despite being fixedly associated with science fiction, Wells wrote extensively in other genres and on many subjects, including history, society and politics, and was heavily influenced by Darwinism. His first book, Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought, offered predictions about what technology and society would look like in the year 2000, many of which have proven accurate. Wells went on to pen over fifty novels, numerous non-fiction books, and dozens of short stories. His legacy has had an overwhelming influence on science fiction, popular culture, and even on technological and scientific innovation. Wells died in 1946 at the age of 79.</p><h2>Mentoring: The Tao of Giving and Receiving Wisdom</h2><p>The new model for business and personal relationships based on the simple yet profound principle of mentoring--both giving and receiving knowledge in a creative mutual exchange.</p><p>Defining mentoring as "a two-way circular dance that provides opportunities for us to experience both giving and receiving without limitations and fears," the authors of Thinking Body, Dancing Mind (LJ 7/92) have written a short book of meditations on relationships that is based on Taoist concepts. The major part of the book features 33 "virtues of the heart and soul" (wang tao). Each virtue, presented first in Chinese and Western calligraphy, is given a poetic definition, followed by a summary of Taoist wisdom. Practical applications of the virtue and its relevance to modern times is finally discussed. The book is best regarded as a source of inspirational meditation rather than an introduction to Taoist principles or a self-help guide to relationships.

Kristeva, you see, is not your average writer of detective fiction. She is a psychoanalyst and linguistic theorist, the author of books on both language and depression--two themes she weaves through this intellectual mystery. The tale begins with Gloria Harrison, a translator who is murdered and decapitated after a dinner party. Enter Stephanie Delacour, an old friend of the victim and a journalist with a nose for murder. Though Kristeva has provided all the necessary components for a standard mystery--a victim, several suspects, and a detective--she seems far more interested in exploring the psychological issues surrounding her characters than the crime itself. The pages of <i>Possessions</i> are filled with reflections on motherhood, depression, semiotics, and more. So if you're looking for a mystery novel that will stimulate your brain rather than your adrenaline production, <i>Possessions</i> is a good place to start.This sequel to Julia Kristeva&#39;s celebrated allegory The Old Man and the Wolves returns to the corrupt seaside resort of a mythical town, where the boundaries between East and West, civilization and barbarism, and good and evil are erased. Part mystery, part meditation, this engrossing tale features the return of Parisian amateur detective and newspaper reporter Stephanie Delacour (Kristeva&#39;s alter ego), drawn into the mystery of a friend&#39;s murder. The story opens with the gruesome discovery of the decapitated body of gifted translator Gloria Harrison. Delacour finds herself participating in the investigation in the company of Detective Superintendent Northrup Rilsky. As the mystery unfolds, Delacour veers away from Rilsky&#39;s investigation, on to a trail that leads to the real killer. Kristeva uses the classic thriller genre to animate the themes that run through her work as a linguist and philosopher. While Stephanie Delacour probes a brilliant gallery of suspects, we read between the lines some of the sorrows and dilemmas that are the focus of Kristeva&#39;s own life and work: motherhood and the complex relationship between mother and child; art and music; psychoanalysis; mourning and melancholia; language; the powers of horror; and the hostility aroused by a competent, gifted, and attractive woman who is at once devotedly maternal and capable of sexual passion.</p><h2>Stop and Smell the Roses: A Mutts Treasury (Volume 18)</h2><p>Patrick McDonnell is a major animal welfare advocate.

He is the author of Martin Buber: The Life of Dialogue, which Buber himself called "the classic study of my thought," and Martin Buber&#x2019;s Life and Work, which won the National Jewish Book Award in 1985.Buber, the most noted Jewish philosopher of the 20th century, has had a profound influence on contemporary thought through his theory of an inspired and direct dialog between man and God. In this biography, Friedman, a recognized authority on Buber, contributes a clear and lucid analysis largely based on his three-volume Martin Buber's Life and Work ( LJ 4/1/84). He traces Buber's career showing the pivotal events in his life as well as the influences of Judaism, Christianity, general philosophical thought, and linguistics on his writings and lectures. Friedman analyzes succinctly, but with great care, Buber's responses to the important events of the 20th century: the two World Wars, the Holocaust, postwar Germany from 1945-61, and the establishment of Israel and the Jewish-Arab problem. He also deftly explores Buber's differences with Theodor Herzl, David Ben-Gurion, Carl Jung, Jean Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, and Dag Hammarskjold.

With these tools we can create a life that is more fulfilling-a life in which we are no longer at the mercy of the stress of our day. The practices can transform the mundane into the extraordinary, and renew our sense of vitality and passion for life.</p><p> Learning to be mindful of our bodies can be hard in this fast-paced, stressful world. Some of us live from the neck up, forgetting to nourish and appreciate-or even be comfortable in-our bodies. In the western world we often live nearly entirely in the mind. Through mindful practices, this book will help bring us back into our bodies and help us reduce stress, breathe again, and actually enjoy our bodies. We're also incredibly self-critical of our bodies. Who among us hasn't wished they were just a little skinnier, more muscular, taller, had a narrower foot, darker hair, lighter eyes... the list of our inadequacies is endless. We are very self-critical of our bodies and often have distorted perceptions of ourselves. We needlessly compare ourselves to some unattainable-and airbrushed-ideal. This often leads to feeling cut off from our bodies and, ultimately, disembodied. We then end up making unhealthy choices, such as eating foods that don't make us feel good, drinking too much, or even over-exercising, all in an effort to try to feel better about ourselves.</p><br></p><p>Jeffrey Brantley, MD, is a consulting associate in the Duke Department of Psychiatry and the founder and director of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program at Duke University's Center for Integrative Medicine.

This type of injury is deeper than it is wide, and consequently is hard to cleanse. Thus, a wound of this type is often a prime site of infection. Puncture wounds may be classified in three ways:<br> 1. as penetrating wounds, which go into a body cavity <br> 2. as perforating wounds, which go into a body cavity and back out again <br> 3. as stabbing wounds, which go only into deep tissue<br> Because puncture wounds cannot be completely reached by air (due to their characteristic shape), they are often susceptible to infections of tetanus, a disease caused by germs active only in anaerobic (airless) conditions. <br> Although signs of this disease may not appear for up to three weeks after a wound has healed, it is vital that toxoid or antitoxin injection be given within 24 to 48 hours after an injury occurs. The booster of tetanus antitoxin or toxoid, depending on past immunization, is immediately necessary, for the toxoid or antitoxin will have no effect after the signs of tetanus have appeared.<br> Punctures of the Hoof<br> Most puncture wounds that occur in the hoof are the result of nail injuries. If a nail is found in the hoof, it should be carefully pulled out and its site of entry noted. If the nail has dislodged and the location of the hole is not known, hoof tester can be used to detect the sore area in the foot. Once the entry site has been located, the sole should be pared with a hoof knife until the hole is reached and an opening for drainage made from the bottom of the hole, widening as it extends toward the surface of the sole. If infection is suspected, the foot should be soaked in either hot, antiseptic solutions or in warm water with magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) added. The hole can then be packed with iodine-soaked cotton, which should be changed daily for several days. If swelling and inflammation do not subside, an operation to drain the abscess will often be required. Usually, after this operation, a horse may be shod with a shoe having an attached steel plate of rubber pads which can be periodically removed for examining the injured area.</p><h2>Beyond Sight: The True Story of a Near-Death Experience</h2><p>SPIRITUAL NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE Synopsis: Author Marion Rome almost died, and returned to tell the tale. And the story she brings us? There is so much less to fear in life &#x2013; or death &#x2013; than we think. In this frank and compassionate account, we hear how death doesn&#x2019;t really exist, it doesn&#x2019;t take religion to get to &#x2018;heaven&#x2019;, and love is our ultimate purpose. We learn what it feels like to experience life as a soul freed of its bodily constraints, once more aware of our true place in the universe. Her near-death experience has led Marion to transform her working life, and to put love first. She has also learned to forgive &#x2013; herself, for times when she has lashed out or let people down, and those, even her own mother, who have hurt her badly in this physical realm. Marion shares her NDE in detail, including her encounter with the super-loving souls that exist beyond our everyday senses, and invites you to join her in seeing beyond fear, guilt and blame to recognise the potential we all have to connect with universal love throughout our earthly lives.</p><p></p><h2>Shakespeare and the Renaissance Concept of Honor (Princeton Legacy Library, 2358)</h2><p><p>Presenting a background study of honor, the author compares ancient concepts with the sympathetic restatements of them that appeared during the Renaissance.

He directed a documentary following a year in the life of J. K. Rowling. James Runcie lives in London and Edinburgh.&#34;&#34;Anglican Canon Sidney Chambers, like his friend and colleague, Inspector Geordie Keating, is never off duty. Yet Chambers must balance his clerical obligations, his recent marriage, and the detective work he relishes, plus a role in a film based on a Dorothy Sayers novel, while bearing in mind his archdeacon&#x2019;s directive to avoid distractions from his religious life. Warning aside, Chambers is instrumental in solving four crimes in 1962&#x2013;63 in and around Grantchester: three murders by a killer targeting clergymen, the theft of a museum painting, the seemingly accidental death of a movie actor, and the abduction of a baby from a hospital. While so many crimes in a single volume may distract new readers of the Grantchester mysteries, of which this is the third of a projected six, Runcie&#x2019;s gently persistent protagonist is almost sure to win fans, whether he&#x2019;s engaged in active sleuthing or musing on the nature of evil or love. Major life changes here lead to new beginnings for Chambers that should whet interest in future volumes of these charming cozies just touched with sex and violence. --Michele Leber</p><h2>The Book of Sainte Foy (The Middle Ages Series)</h2><p><p>The miracle stories surrounding Sainte Foy form one of the most complete sets of material relating to a medieval saint's cult and its practices. Pamela Sheingorn's superb translation from the Medieval Latin texts now makes this literature available in English. <i>The Book of Sainte Foy</i> recounts the virgin saint's martyrdom in the third century (<i>Passio</i>), the theft of her relics in the late ninth century by the monks of the monastery at Conques (<i>Translatio</i>), and her diverse miracles (<i>Liber miraculorum</i>); also included is a rendering of the Proven�al Chanson de Sainte Foy, translated by Robert L. A. Clark.</p><p>The miracles distinguish Sainte Foy as an unusual and highly individualistic child saint displaying a fondness for gold and pretty things, as well as a penchant for playing practical jokes on her worshippers. In his record of Sainte Foy, Bernard of Angers, the eleventh-century author of the first parts of the <i>Liber miraculorum</i>, emphasized the saint's "unheard of" miracles, such as replacing missing body parts and bringing dead animals back to life.</p><p>The introduction to the volume situates Sainte Foy in the history in the history of hagiography and places the saint and her monastery in the social context of the high Middle Ages. Sheingorn also evokes the rugged landscape of south central France, the picturesque village of Conques on the pilgrimage road, and, most important, the golden, jewel-encrusted reliquary statue that medieval believers saw as the embodiment of Sainte Foy's miracle-working power. In no other book will readers enjoy such a comprehensive portrait of Sainte Foy and the culture that nurtured her.</p></p><p>Pamela Sheingorn is Professor of Art at Baruch College, CUNY, and Professor of Medieval Studies at the CUNY Graduate School.</p><h2>The Bahama Islands in full color</h2><p>Dustjacket torn and tattered.</p><p></p><h2>Complete Charleston: A Guide to the Architecture, History and Gardens of Charleston</h2><p>&#34;Complete Charleston&#34; has walking tours of eleven historic neighborhoods plus day trips to Savannah, Beaufort, Georgetown, McClellanville, Brookgreen Gardens and the plantations on the Ashley River.

Or why the very mention of his father's name was forbidden at Court? Or why his mother had decided to pack him off to a backwater planet aboard what was little more than a tramp freighter to represent her at a local political event better suited to a third assistant undersecretarv of state? <br> It probably wasn't too surprising that someone in his position should react by becoming spoiled, selfcentered and petulant. After all, what else did he have to do with his life? <br> But that was before a saboteur tried to blow up his transport. Then warships of the Empire of Man's worst rivals shot the crippled vessel out of space. Then Roger found himself shipwrecked on the planet Marduk, whose jungles were full of damnbeasts, killerpillars, carnivorous plants, torrential rain, and barbarian hordes with really <i>bad</i> dispositions. Now all Roger has to do is hike halfway around the entire planet, then capture a spaceport from the Bad Guys, somehow commandeer a starship, and then go home to Mother for explanations. <br> Fortunately, Roger has an ace in the hole: Bravo Company of Bronze Battalion of The Empress' Own Regiment. If anyone can get him off Marduk alive, it's the Bronze Barbarians. <br> Assuming that Prince Roger manages to grow up before he gets all of them killed.</p><p><p><strong>David Weber</strong> is author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Honor Harrington series as well as other popular novels, including some based on his <em>Starfire </em>science fiction strategy game. He lives in South Carolina with his wife and their three children.</p>An established master of military SF, Weber, and a fast-rising comer in the genre, Ringo, combine forces in the first of a new series sure to please their fans. Prince Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock has a problem. Thanks to terrorist sabotage, he and a company of space marines are marooned in the wilderness of the planet Marduk, noted for high mountains, high temperatures, low technology and the short tempers of its nine-foot, four-armed, slime-covered natives. They have to get out of this place. In their effort to do so, they win allies among the Mardukans (mostly in legitimate ways) and overcome others by judiciously combining sneakiness and firepower. Along the way, the prince turns from a spoiled brat into a useful, even valuable member of the company. This coming-of-age theme often crops up in military SF, and indeed both authors are working within territory they know well. The pace never gets too slow, despite generous world-building and extended action scenes. Another strength is the deceptively deep characterization particularly of Prince Roger, whose transformation draws on skills and character traits carefully planted early in the novel. The book could actually use more background (the villainous terrorist Saints are shadow figures) and ends on a cliff-hanger (or cliff-climber), but overall the superb storytelling will add considerably to the reputation of both authors.

For nearly three decades a peace forged in blood and fatigue has held sway in North America. Now, Japan dominates the Pacific, the Russian Tsar rules Alaska, and England, under Winston Churchill, chafes for a return to its former glory. But behind the fa�ade of world order, America is a bomb waiting to go off. Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. <br><br>In the White House in Philadelphia, Socialist President Al Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the fires of war and the flood tides of depression. In the South, Featherston and his ruling Freedom Party have put down a Negro rebellion with a bloody fist and have interned them in concentration camps. Now they are determined to crush their Northern neighbor at any cost. <br><br>Featherston&#x2019;s planes attack Philadelphia without warning. The U.S.A. lashes back blindly at Charleston. And a terrible second coming is at hand. When the CSA blitzkrieg is launched, the U.S.A. is caught flat-footed. Before long, the gray Army reaches Lake Erie. But in its wake the war machine is spinning a vortex of destruction, betrayal, and fury that no one, not even Jake Featherston himself, can control. <br><br>Now, President Smith faces a Herculean task, while an obscure assistant secretary of war named Roosevelt rises in his ranks. For the U.S.A., the darkest days still lay ahead. Across the globe, a new era of war has just begun. And in the hands of the incomparable Harry Turtledove, readers are treated to a masterful vision of what might have been. An enduring portrait of history, nations, and human nature in its many manifestations, <i>Return Engagement</i> is a monumental journey into the second half of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Harry Turtledove</b> was born in Los Angeles in 1949.

She&#x2019;d dreamt she was trapped in a burning building, with fire alarms and sirens screaming all around her. When her eyes opened, she thought for a dreadful moment that she was still dreaming, for sirens were wail- ing outside. Then reason returned along with consciousness, and the Congresswoman from New York groaned. Those were air-raid sirens, which could only mean the war had started at last.<br><br>Or maybe it&#x2019;s a drill, Flora thought, snatching desperately at hope, though a drill at&#x2014;she looked at the alarm clock on the nightstand&#x2014;four in the morning struck her as madness. Of course, a new round of war between the United States and the Confederate States struck her as madness, too.<br><br>Antiaircraft guns in the defense ring around Philadelphia began to pound. That sound banished the last vestiges of doubt. Guns inside the de facto capital of the USA opened up a moment later. Through the gunfire and the sirens, she heard a deep, distant throbbing that rapidly grew louder. Those were Confederate bombers overhead.<br><br>She sprang out of bed and threw a housecoat on over the thin cotton nightgown she&#x2019;d worn against the muggy heat of the first days of summer in Philadelphia. She had one arm in the quilted housecoat and one arm out when she suddenly stopped in outrage that seemed ridiculous only later. &#x201c;That bastard!&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t even declare war!&#x201d;<br><br>A new sound joined the cacophony outside: the thin whistle of falling bombs. As the first explosions made the windows of her flat rattle and shake, she realized President Jake Featherston of the CSA wouldn&#x2019;t have to send Al Smith, his U.S. counterpart, any formal messages now.<br><br>Fear joined outrage. She could die here. So could her son. She ran to his bedroom and threw open the door. &#x201c;Joshua! Get up!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to get down to the basement! The war is here!&#x201d;<br><br>Only a snore answered her. At sixteen, Joshua could sleep through anything, and he&#x2019;d proved it. Sirens? Antiaircraft guns? Droning bombers? Bombs? Probing searchlights? His mother yelling? They were all one to him, and likewise all nothing to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Get up!&#x201d; Flora shouted again. Still no response. She went over to the bed and shook him. &#x201c;Get up!&#x201d;<br><br>That did the job. Joshua Blackford sat up and muttered for a moment. He didn&#x2019;t doubt what was going on around him the way his mother had. &#x201c;They really went and did it!&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, they really did,&#x201d; Flora agreed grimly. Bombs were bursting closer now, underscoring her words. &#x201c;Come on. Get moving. Put on a bathrobe or something and get downstairs with me. We don&#x2019;t have time to dawdle.&#x201d;<br><br>Later, she would discover that putting on a bathrobe when you were already wearing pajamas was dawdling, too. But that would be later. In the wee small hours of June 22, 1941, she was doing as well as she could.<br><br>Someone pounded on the door. &#x201c;Get out! Get downstairs!&#x201d; a hoarse male voice yelled.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re coming!&#x201d; Flora shouted back. Joshua flew into a terry-cloth robe. Flora grabbed a key and locked the door behind her when she and her son left the apartment. Those niceties would also go by the board later on.<br><br>Down the stairs they scurried, along with the other members of Congress and bureaucrats and businessmen and their families who rented here. For the moment, everybody was equal: equal in fear and equal in fury. In the darkness of the stairwell, people said exactly what they thought of Jake Featherston, the Freedom Party, and the Confederate States of America. Flora heard some things she&#x2019;d never heard before. No one cared if women were within earshot. Some of the most inflammatory things came from the mouths of women, as a matter of fact.<br><br>The basement was dark, too, dark and crowded and hot and stuffy. Someone lit a match to start a cigarette. The brief flare of light might have been a bomb itself. Flora wished she hadn&#x2019;t thought of that comparison. If a bomb did hit this building . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Sh&#x2019;ma yisroayl, adonai elohaynu, adonai ekhod,&#x201d; she murmured, just in case.<br><br>More bombs burst, some of them very close. The basement shook, as if at an earthquake. Plaster pattered down from the ceiling. A woman screamed. A man groaned. Beside Flora, Joshua whispered, &#x201c;Wow!&#x201d;<br><br>She wanted to hit him and kiss him at the same time. He was reacting to the spectacle, to what people were doing all around him. Fear? He knew nothing of fear because at his age he didn&#x2019;t really believe anything could happen to him. Flora was heading into her mid-fifties. She knew perfectly well that disaster could knock on the door.<br><br>A rending crash came from outside, different from the sharp, staccato roars of the exploding bombs. &#x201c;We got one of the fuckers, anyway,&#x201d; a man said in tones of ferocious satisfaction.<br><br>A bomber. That was what that had to be. A Confederate bomber had smashed to earth somewhere not far away. How many young men had been aboard it? How many had managed to get clear and parachute away before it went into its last fatal dive? And how many Philadelphians had they killed before they were shot down? If you were going to ask the other questions, you had to ask that one, too.<br><br>The raid lasted a little more than an hour. Little by little, bombs came at longer intervals. The drone of engines overhead faded. The antiaircraft guns kept ravening away for several minutes after the bombers were gone. Some of them went on shooting even after the continuous all-clear note replaced the warbling rise and fall of the air-raid alarm.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that was fun,&#x201d; somebody behind Flora said. Along with half a dozen other people, she laughed&#x2014;probably louder than the joke deserved. But it cut the tension, and there had been enough tension in the air to need a lot of cutting.<br><br>&#x201c;What do we do now, Mom?&#x201d; Joshua asked.<br><br>&#x201c;We go back up to the flat and see what happened to it,&#x201d; Flora answered. &#x201c;Then I have to go in to Congress. Featherston may not have bothered with a declaration of war, but President Smith will, and they&#x2019;ll need me to vote for it.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in 1914, as a Socialist agitator in New York City, she&#x2019;d urged her party not to vote for the credits that financed the opening act of the Great War. She remained a Socialist. These days, though, the country had a Socialist president (which would have seemed unimaginable in 1914) and had been wantonly attacked by the Confederate States (which wouldn&#x2019;t have seemed surprising at all).<br><br>As they left the basement, morning twilight was brightening toward dawn. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why the Confederate bombers went home,&#x201d; Joshua said as they climbed stairs. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t want to hang around when our gunners and fighter pilots could get a good look at them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know I had a son on the General Staff,&#x201d; Flora said. Joshua snorted but looked immensely proud of himself.<br><br>When they went back into the apartment, they found glass everywhere: on the floors, on the beds, some glittering shards driven deep into the plaster of the far wall. The windows were gone, every single one of them. Flora eyed the shards with a fresh horror. What would those flying fragments of glass have done to people whose soft flesh happened to get in the way? Butchered them. That was the only word Flora could think of.<br><br>Joshua was staring out at the city. His head slowly swung from left to right, taking it all in like a panning newsreel camera. Flora joined him. There were bomb craters half a block down the street. A little farther away, a black, greasy pillar of smoke rose into the sky. Was that the bomber&#x2019;s pyre? She thought so.<br><br>More columns of smoke rose all over Philadelphia. Most of them came from the center of town, where government buildings had gone up ever since the 1880s. Most, but not all. The Confederates had dropped bombs all over the city. Bad aim? Deliberate terror? Who could guess?<br><br>Fire engine sirens screeched as the sun came up over the horizon. When Flora tried to turn on the bathroom lamp, she discovered the power had gone out. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave the icebox open very long&#x2014;it lets the cold out,&#x201d; she called to Joshua as she dressed. They had an electric refrigerator, but she was used to the older word. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Congress.&#x201d; She hurried out the door and down the stairs.<br><br>Two Representatives and a Senator were already at the curb trying to flag a taxi. Flora got one by walking out in the street in front of it. The driver didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;quite&#x2014;run over her. All the elected officials piled in. &#x201c;To Congress!&#x201d; they bawled.<br><br>The neoclassical mountain of a building where the Senate and House met had escaped damage, though firemen were fighting flames in the office building across the street and dragging bodies out of it. &#x201c;Joint session!&#x201d; Flora didn&#x2019;t even know where she first heard it, but it was everywhere as soon as she got into the rotunda. &#x201c;President Smith will address a joint session.&#x201d;<br><br>A joint session meant shoehorning the Senate into the far larger House chamber along with the Representatives. Today, there were still some empty seats after that: members of Congress who couldn&#x2019;t get to the session or who were injured or dead. A joint session also meant the risk of a lucky bomb taking out the whole legislative branch and the President. Flora wished she hadn&#x2019;t thought of that.<br><br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States!&#x201d; the Speaker of the House boomed out. The wave of applause that greeted Al Smith was fierce and savage.<br><br>Smith himself looked like hell.

Includes many poems used in Arseny's son's films (Andrei Tarkovsky). With a bibliography of both Arseny and his son Andrei Tarkovsky, and illustrations from Tarkovsky's movies. This is one of the very few translations in English of poetry by Arseny Tarkovsky available. FROM THE INTRODUCTION: Arseny Aleksandrovich Tarkovsky was was born in June 1907 in Elizavetgrad, later named Kirovograd. He studied at the Academy of Literature in Moscow from 1925 to 1929, and also worked in the editorial office of the journal Gudok. He was well respected as a translator, especially of the Oriental classics, but was little known as a poet for most of his life, being unable to get any of his own work published during the Stalinist era. His poems did not begin to appear in book form until he was over fifty. His son, the film director Andrei Tarkovsky, made extensive use of his father's in some of his films, and certain of his diary entries indicate the esteem in which the poet was held in the Soviet Union towards the end of his life. An entry written after Andrei had given a talk at the Moscow Physical Institute in 1980, for instance, reproduces the following note from a member of the audience: 'An enormous number of people in this hall admire Arseny Aleksandrovich Tarkovsky as a great Russian poet. Please convey our respects to him.' One of the few recorded public appearances of Arseny Tarkovsky was at the funeral of Anna Akhmatova; he was one of three writers deputed to accompany her coffin from Domodedovo to Leningrad, and he read both at her funeral in Komarovo and at the first evening held in her memory in Moscow. He died in 1989 and is now beginning to be recognised as one of the many significant Russian poets of the twentieth century. From the poem &#x2018;Ignatyevo Forest': The last leaves' embers in total immolation Rise into the sky; this whole forest Seethes with irritation, just as we did That last year we lived together.

Johannesburg is Africa&#x2019;s premier metropolis. Yet theories of urbanization have cast it as an emblem of irresolvable crisis, the spatial embodiment of unequal economic relations and segregationist policies, and a city that responds to but does not contribute to modernity on the global scale. Complicating and contesting such characterizations, the contributors to this collection reassess classic theories of metropolitan modernity as they explore the experience of &#x201c;city-ness&#x201d; and urban life in post-apartheid South Africa. They portray Johannesburg as a polycentric and international city with a hybrid history that continually permeates the present. Turning its back on rigid rationalities of planning and racial separation, Johannesburg has become a place of intermingling and improvisation, a city that is fast developing its own brand of cosmopolitan culture.<p></p><p>The volume&#x2019;s essays include an investigation of representation and self-stylization in the city, an ethnographic examination of friction zones and practices of social reproduction in inner-city Johannesburg, and a discussion of the economic and literary relationship between Johannesburg and Maputo, Mozambique&#x2019;s capital. One contributor considers how Johannesburg&#x2019;s cosmopolitan sociability enabled the anticolonial projects of Mohandas Ghandi and Nelson Mandela. Journalists, artists, architects, writers, and scholars bring contemporary Johannesburg to life in ten short pieces, including reflections on music and megamalls, nightlife, built spaces, and life for foreigners in the city.</p><p><i>Contributors</i>: Arjun Appadurai, Carol A.

The essays challenge dominant models of urbanism and demonstrate with force and subtlety how African cities in general and Johannesburg in particular outpace urban theory. Each essay `de-scribes' the city now in order to envision the city to come. In this volume, we hear--over the droning clich�s that still circulate about the African city's ruin and decadence--another note, another cadence."--Ackbar Abbas, author of Hong Kong: Culture and the Politics of Disappearance <p>"An extraordinary exploration of what is so often left out of accounts about cities: what is beneath and what is at the edge.

(Readers under thirty tend to think of Vietnam as ancient history.) Also, World War I had no clearly defined set of causes, only a hazy termination, and very few set-piece battles or campaigns. This excellent resource work should cure most of those problems for the reader willing to take the time to absorb it. There are five major sections plus a couple of shorter addenda, each of which can be dipped into for browsing, consulted for a reference question, or simply read straight through. "History of the War" is just what it says: a sixty-page historical and geographical narrative with lots of maps which is an excellent summary of the whole conflict, from Sarajevo to the Armistice. "Weapons and Tactics" will be the meat of the book for many readers, with detailed discussions of rifles in use by various nations, the role of sniping, the advent of the machine gun, and so on. "The Warring Nations" covers each of the sixty-odd countries and colonies that took part, at least on paper. Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and the U.S. have the longest sections, naturally, but you'll also find here Lithuania, Brazil, India, Persia, Luxemburg, and Siam. (Siam?) Each of these articles summarizes the country's political situation on the eve of the war, its participation, active or otherwise, and what happened to it afterwards. Then there's "Biographies," which offers short sketches of forty-six key figures on all sides of the war. "Sources" is not only an excellent bibliography for further reading, it includes lists of literature that came out of the war, plus art and photography. A miscellaneous section discusses rations, prize money, and some other odds and ends, and a very good glossary of technical jargon and military slang rounds things out. Footnotes appear throughout, especially to the scattered quotations and excerpts from original sources, and every single article and sketch includes a list of "References" which by themselves are almost worth the not-high price of the book. If you feel a gap in your grasp of the political and military history of the first "war that changed everything," this is the place to start. Highly recommended. --By Michael K. Smith<br><br>The book has everything you need in order to understand all aspects of the war. The first part reviews the campaigns, naval operations, casualty lists, and chronology of the different fronts. The second part reviews the weapons and tactics from both sides. And, the third part, which is truly amazing, the author gives detailled reports on all the nations involved. The author obviously spent a great amount of time researching all the information required for the novel. The novel should be highly recommended for anyone interested in this dark period of our history. --By Shawn Smith</p><h2>Paradise (American Literature)</h2><p>&#34;No other word for it: a charming book.&#34; Peter S. Prescott, Newsweek</p><p>Donald Barthelme was one of the most influential American novelists of the 1970s and 1980s, bringing a unique postmodern voice to his novels, short stories and essays. He died in 1989.What is paradise? Not Adam's who had only one Eve, but Simon's who has three. Simon, a 53-year-old architect "with a tragic sense of brick," gives himself a year's sabbatical from his firm in Philadelphia and his ruinous marriage, takes an apartment in New York and by one of those everyday coincidences that makes urban life so zingy is moved in on by not one, not two, but three beautiful fashion models so impossibly young they don't know the name Benny Goodman or the century of World War II. They do know all manner of games to add interest to rainy mornings, however. A "male fantasy" is what the implausibly articulate and well-read ladies call the arrangement, and they tell Simon he's living in "hog heaven." The slight novel, which includes random meditations on a variety of matters, unfolds mainly in dialogue and one-liners, many of them actually in Q &amp; A form. At times, Barthelme strains for his gags and comic effects, and jokes fall flat or topple into whimsy; but it is amazing how often and well the wit comes off. What is even more amazing is that this odd foursome, this "loving quartet," constitutes a kind of family. When the women leave to pick up the frayed threads of their lives, Simon is forlorn, inconsolable, a desolate "uncle-figure," as one of them calls him. By the end of the book, we too miss them. Best known for his short stories (nine books of them so far), Barthelme has written two earlier novelsThe Dead Father in 1975 and Snow White in 1967.

HOUSE OF MYSTERY focuses on five characters trapped in a supernatural bar, trying to solve the mystery of how and why they&#39;re imprisoned there. Each one has a terrible past they&#39;d like to forget, and with no books, newspapers or TV allowed in the House, they face an eternity of boredom. But stories become the new currency, and fortunately, the House attracts only the finest storytellers.</p><p>Matthew Sturges&#39; work includes the novel Midwinter and anthologies Live Without A Net and Revolution SF.

He is currently writer/artist of Shadowpact and Fables.Jack of Fables writers Willingham and Sturges trade places on the masthead of a new, quite a bit creepier series that swirls around a big, elaborate house of many architectural styles with an interior far more expansive than the exterior implies. Perched on an intersection of realities, it&#x2019;s a place you arrive at unexpectedly and leave only at the seeming whim of the house itself. Attempts to break out short-circuit you back into the place and its grounds. Everyone soon lands in the ground-floor saloon and is expected to tell a tale for admittance; since the length of anyone&#x2019;s sojourn is indefinite, everyone obliges. So the main story&#x2014;concerned with Fig Keele, who, fleeing in terror her imploding Austin, Texas, home, runs into the house&#x2014;is regularly interrupted by drinkers&#x2019; yarns, all of the type of which nightmares are made. Luca Rossi draws the main story to look like a literally edgier Fables, and five stylistically disparate artists draw the inserted tales.

Viehl </b>is the author of several novels including the Stardoc series, the Bio Rescue series, as well as <i>Paradise Island, </i>and <i>Blade Dancer. </i>She lives in Florida with her family.<b>Yesterday</b><p>When I woke up, it was in the oddest of circumstances. I was crammed into a very small space, with my legs tucked in and my shoulders pressing against what felt like a tiny console. I opened my eyes and found two small, slimy faces close to mine. "Who are you?"</p><p>"Rilken." One of the diminutive aliens reached out and prodded me with a sticky finger. "You Terran?"</p><p>"Uh-huh." I tried to sit up, found I couldn't, and swiveled onto my stomach instead. I was inside what had to be the smallest vessel I'd ever seen. A lavatory on the <i>Sunlace</i> was ten times bigger. "Why am I here?"</p><p>"We purchase you from Bartermen." One of the little guys went to an equally tiny helm and initiated some engines. "Prepare for launch."</p><p>"Wait a minute." I managed to hunch over and sit up, and immediately felt like Gulliver. I filled up half the passenger compartment, which had been designed for beings less than half a meter in height. "Where are we going?"</p><p>"We are leaving Oenrall," the other pip-squeak said. "We are mercenaries. You will be returned to the Hsktskt for blood bounty."</p><p>Midget mercenaries. Well, why not? "You're friends with the lizards?"</p><p>He shrugged his tiny shoulders. "The Hsktskt offer more credits for you."</p><p>The tiny vessel lifted off and entered the upper atmosphere. Before the mercenaries could initiate their flightshield, something struck us.</p><p>"What is it?" The one guarding me ran up to the helm.</p><p>"A Jorenian ship, firing on us." Fear ran through the Rilken's voice. "They have disabled our stardrive."</p><p>Considering the size of the ship, Xonea must have used a peashooter. I crawled up behind both of them, and felt for the syrinpress I'd been carrying in my tunic pocket. It was gone, so I'd have to use more creative measures.</p><p>"Nighty-night, boys." I knocked their skulls together once, then watched them slide to the floor. I looked around me. "That's it? I don't get shot, stabbed, poisoned, whipped, burned, or anything else?"</p><p>The Rilkens didn't make a response.</p><p>Clunking them was certainly easier than using their communications array. I had to use one of my fingernails to operate the control panel. At last I raised the <i>CloudWalk</i> to let them know I was in control and all right.</p><p>"It is good to see you, council representative," the Jado ClanLeader said, and smiled. "There are two others here who wish to relay their happiness, as well."</p><p>He stepped aside, and the welcome sight of my husband and daughter appeared on the vid screen.</p><p>"Cherijo." My husband looked very relieved. "You escaped the Bartermen by yourself?"</p><p>"Mtulla helped. By the way, if you ever want to get kidnapped, pick Rilkens. Very easy species to overpower. Marel could do it." I thought of the peace talks. "Have I ruined everything for Captain Teulon?"</p><p>"No, it appears the negotiations are a success. The Torins retrieved Alunthri from the Jxin, and it has convinced the Taercal that your cure is a divine intervention, and that their god refuses to allow them to suffer, as was prophesied."</p><p>"About time." I moved one of the sleeping Rilkens out of my way and sat back against the interior hull wall. "Well, I think that wraps it up here. I'd really like that vacation now, please."</p><p>"Come and get us."</p><p>Reever told me how to fly the Rilken vessel to rendezvous with the Jado ship, then touched the screen with his hand. "I'll be waiting for you, <i>Waenara</i>."</p><p>I matched my fingertips to his. "Not for long, <i>Osepeke</i>."</p><p>Those last words we exchanged would come back to haunt me. I just didn't know it yet.</p><p>Because the shot from the Jado had wrecked the stardrive, I could only coax limping speed out of the propulsion system. I set the helm on autopilot, tied up the Rilkens so they wouldn't cause any more trouble when they woke, and tried to make myself comfortable by stretching out my legs on the deck. I'd always felt like a shrimp compared with most other beings, so it was kind of a novelty to experience for once what it was like to be a giant.</p><p>I didn't expect ClanLeader Jado to send a launch to meet me, so when one appeared on the exterior viewer, I reached for the dinky console to send a signal. "Reever told me how to use the ship's position to navigate to the <i>CloudWalk</i>, Captain. I won't get lost."</p><p>No one responded, and when I peered at the console, I saw several warning lights blinking. Someone was jamming my transceiver, which wasn't a good thing. Neither was the launch, the design of which wasn't Jorenian, but League.</p><p>I tried another signal, this time opening the relay so it could be picked up by the other vessel. "League transport, identify yourself, and your reasons for approaching my vessel."</p><p>A harsh voice responded with only four words. "Prepare to be boarded."</p><p>"Prepare my ass." I swung around and crouched over the console, taking it off auto control and changing course to evade the League transport.</p><p>I dodged them for a while, but their engines were working perfectly, as was their pulse array. They fired twice and took out what was left of the Rilkens' propulsion system, then used a third to destroy my transceiver.</p><p>I couldn't see the <i>CloudWalk</i> on the viewer, but I knew they were out there and monitoring my progress, as was the ship belonging to my adopted family, HouseClan Torin. They'd definitely pick up the pulse fire on their scanners. Any attack on a member of a Jorenian HouseClan resulted in a declaration of ClanKill, which meant my adopted kin would devote themselves to hunting down my assailants and subjecting them to an instant and painful death by manual evisceration.</p><p>"You guys are going to be so sorry you did this," I muttered as I looked around the cabin for weapons.</p><p>The Rilkens had a couple of pistols and rifles, but they were too small for me to handle comfortably. I settled for a dagger I took off one of my unconscious abductors, although I had to wrap the hilt with some plastape until it was large enough for me to grip. I staggered as the deck rocked; the viewer showed the transport's docking clamps engulfing the little ship.</p><p>I put my back against a wall and watched the upper access hatch. Energy crackled through the air, and then something knocked me away from the wall and threw me to the deck.</p><p>I crawled, my teeth still chattering from the power surge they'd sent through the hull, but there was no place big enough for me to hide. A pair of League boots appeared in front of my nose, and I raised my head to look into the business end of a pulse rifle.</p><p>"Colonel Shropana sends his compliments," the soldier said just before he reversed the weapon and slammed the stock into my face.</p><br><br><p><b>Part One</b><br>Today</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><i>Into whatever houses I enter, I will go for the benefit of the sick. &#x2013; Hippocrates</i></p><p>Hippocrates never had to deal with a patient like mine, or he'd have said to hell with his oath and run for the hills.</p><p>As I was currently on the <i>Sunlace</i>, a Jorenian interstellar star vessel, I didn't have hills or that luxury. What I did have was a body on the exam table in front of me: Terran, adult female, petite, thin, pale-skinned, and dark-haired. Uninjured but unconscious, waiting to be awakened, to be healed, to be saved.</p><p>Standing there in the cold, sterile brightness of the medical assessment room, dependent on the kindness of a bunch of strangers, I could relate.</p><p>Visually speaking, the patient did not appear to be a sterling example of her gender or her species. I'd never call her pretty, shapely, vibrant, or attractive. She didn't have the benefit of physical symmetry; her long-fingered, narrow hands appeared overly large for her bony wrists; her long torso seemed at odds with her short legs. Her translucent skin didn't have a mark on it, which made it look like a too-tight envirosuit, and displayed in outline a bit too much of her skeletal structure. Although I knew her to be in her midthirties, at first glance I'd have guessed her to be a moderately undernourished adolescent.</p><p>I picked up her chart. "Not much to look at, is she?" The herd of tall, blue-skinned Jorenian interns and nurses gathered around the table didn't respond. "Until we open the really boring package, and get a look at all the prizes inside."</p><p>"Healer, what say we summon your bondmate?" That came from a gorgeous female nurse whose name I didn't know. She wove her fingers through the air as she spoke in the eloquent hand gestures her species used as part of their language. "He would wish to be present."</p><p>I watched her white-within-white eyes, which were not at all as blind as they appeared. "Do you think I need my husband to hold my hand while I assess this patient, Nurse?"</p><p>She was two feet taller than me and a hundred pounds heavier, and could probably snap my neck with one jerk of her beautiful blue wrist, but she shuffled her feet and ducked her head like a scolded kid. "No, Healer."</p><p>"Good answer." I turned my attention back to the patient. "The Terran female here presents with a genetically enhanced immune system which renders her impervious to infection and disease," I said, not bothering to read from the chart. "Any injury she sustains, including the life-threatening variety, heals in a matter of hours. Her brain capacity is estimated to be several hundred times that of an average Terran, and includes exceptional intelligence, eidetic memory, and select superior motor skills." I glanced at the dismayed faces across from me. "Any of you know how she was created?"</p><p>This time one of the male interns spoke up. "Her parent replicated his own cells and genetically enhanced them to change her gender as well as her physiology."</p><p>"That's correct. You get to skip the pop quiz I'm giving later." I placed the chart back in the holder at the end of the exam table. "The end result was Dr. Cherijo Grey Veil, cloned and refined and engineered from birth to be the perfect physician. Would anyone like to take a stab at diagnosing her current condition?" I showed them some of my teeth. "I'm dying to know what it is."</p><p>"She is violating an order of bed rest," a low voice said from behind me.</p><p>I glanced back at the Senior Healer. Three-armed, one-legged, pink-hided with a bald head and a nest of white, thin, prehensile, meter-long gildrells around his mouth, the Omorr surgeon was my best friend and one of my oldest colleagues.</p><p>Judging by the flush currently darkening his features, he was also as pissed off as I was.</p><p>"Don't forget appropriating medical staff and using diagnostic equipment without proper authorization," I reminded him. "Nice to see you, Senior Healer. They told me you were on Joren." Although how he got there, I had no clue.</p><p>"I was. I jaunted out on a scout to meet the ship. Leave us," Squilyp said to the others as he hopped around to stand on the opposite side of the table.</p><p>Suppressing various expressions, gestures, and sounds of relief, the interns and nurses almost trampled one another trying to get out of the entry panel.</p><p>The Omorr smelled a little like bile, and looked tired, or older&#x2014;or maybe both. A lot of things had changed, and I didn't know why, but I was about to find out.</p><p>Or else.</p><p>"How many transitions did it take for you to get here," I asked, "and how many times did you puke?"</p><p>"Seven jumps," he said. "I vomited twice. What are you doing?"</p><p>"I'm putting together a workup on Dr. Grey Veil here." Or, at least, the dimensional image of her. I was the original, the prototype, the living, breathing version of the simulated woman who currently lay on my exam table, naked and flat on her back. My back. Whatever. "I thought it might be helpful in finding out what the hell is going on, since no one is telling me anything."</p><p>He started to say something, and then changed his mind.

Just as soon as I know how I got on this ship, where it is, who swapped out the crew, and what happened to my injuries."</p><p>"You don't remember?"</p><p>I folded my arms. "What do you think?"</p><p>"What have you been told?"</p><p>"Basically? Nothing. Every time I ask, they railroad me with some nonsense about psychological trauma. They removed nearly all the entries from my chart, and I've been locked out of the medical database." I brushed aside a thick section of her/our hair, creating a part along one side of her/our head. "Is this where I got conked? How bad was it?"</p><p>"I cannot say." He glanced at the simulation to avoid looking at me. "We were not present when you were injured, and the damage healed before you were recovered."</p><p>Obviously, or now I'd be leaking blood or brain matter all over the deck. "Then show me what you extrapolated from my scans after you took me back from the League."</p><p>"I do not have all the details on the incident&#x2014;"</p><p>"God<i>damn</i> it, Squilyp." The last shred of my patience finally parted ways with my temper. "Tell me what the hell happened to me."</p><p>Shouting at him stiffened his gildrells into icicles&#x2014;a sure sign he was offended&#x2014;but he only addressed the control console. "Display program variation C&#x2013;1."</p><p>Like an invisible killer with an unseen ax, the imager erased a good chunk of my twin's skull, vaporizing the bone and exposing the brain tissue. It was such a brutal injury that for a moment I forgot to breathe.</p><p><i>How could I have survived this?</i> I felt ready to puke myself now. Thanks to my enhanced immune system, I could physically survive almost anything, but mentally...emotionally..."That's what that League pirate did to me?"</p><p>"Based on the initial head series I performed, and the few details we were able to garner from one eyewitness, this approximates the wound you sustained after your transport crash-landed on the surface of Akkabarr."</p><p>I glanced up. "What are you talking about? I wasn't anywhere near Akkabarr. I was on that dinky Rilken ship. One of Shropana's jackasses boarded it before he smacked me in the head with the end of a pulse rifle." I regarded the simulation again. "There's no way he did this much damage, unless he kept bashing my skull in after I fell unconscious."</p><p>"That is the last thing you remember?" he asked. "Being assaulted on the Rilkem ship?"</p><p>"That's the last thing that happened to me." I didn't like the careful way he was talking to me. "Right?"</p><p>"Ah, no." His gildrells coiled into knots of agitation. "You were abducted and taken to Akkabarr by a League operative, but the atmospheric conditions caused your transport to crash on the surface. There you were attacked by a group of natives, and shot." He touched the control panel, creating a second, independent image of the brain and projecting the ruined organ above the body, where it slowly revolved. "Due to the weapon being fired at almost point-blank range, it caused considerable damage to the brain center, as well as significant vascular trauma and a substantial amount of tissue destruction."</p><p>I resisted the urge to touch my head. "You're telling me that after this League ship I was on crashed, the natives dragged me out of the wreckage, shot me in the head, and blew out half of my brains."

In honest, gritty prose, Heilman writes about the complex relationships between work, nature, family and community at a time when community itself is as endangered as any job or tree.</p></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s best not to look at the clear cut,&#34; Robert Leo Heilman writes, describing his grueling work as a tree planter in the timber country of Oregon. &#34;You stay busy with whatever is in front of you because, like all industrial processes, there is beauty in the details and ugliness in the larger view. Oil film on a rain puddle has an iridescent sheen that is lovely in a way that the junkyard it&#39;s part of is not.&#34; Heilman&#39;s fine collection of essays, which gives the reader an inside look at the society of loggers, environmentalists, and people who never stop laboring while trying to survive, beautifully illuminates the details of the working life. Alternately joyous and heartrending, evocative of Thoreau and Whitman, these essays by a man who has lived the life he writes about, deserve to be read by a wide audience.In timber industry parlance, overstory: zero means "clear-cut," or removal of all the trees in a stand of timber. Heilman lives in Douglas County, Oregon, the self-styled "Timber Capital of the Nation," a sparsely populated, economically depressed area. For five winters, he worked with a company reforestation crew, planting seedling trees at the rate of 700 a day. A high school dropout, Heilman had more than 30 occupations?logger, sawmill worker, roofer, house painter?before an on-the-job accident left him unable to do hard physical labor. He writes engagingly and with sensitivity about the life of a laborer, about the struggle of a backwater community to survive. Heilman looks at the blue-collar worker's and the middle-class professional's perceptions and prejudices regarding each other. This is a vivid portrait of a "marginal population" and an area in transition. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Penguin English Library Wuthering Heights (The Penguin English Library)</h2><p>The Penguin English Library Edition of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront� &#34;May you not rest, as long as I am living.

Commander of a grand military expedition of Sparta&#39;s devising, and a dependent of Sparta&#39;s influential king Agesilaos, Xenophon knew Sparta from the inside, and - as himself an Athenian in exile - was well placed to comment on Sparta&#39;s difference. The simplicity of his Greek style has a perfume of honesty. And yet... Recent research has with increasing force called into doubt Xenophon&#39;s motives and truthfulness - especially as regards Sparta. Analysis of his Hellenica reveals much evasion and euphemism about Sparta&#39;s failings - complicated by occasional outbursts against the iniquity of Spartan imperialism. His euphemistic Constitution of the Lakedaimonians (itself containing such an outburst), and his near-hagiography of the dead Agesilaos, have variously evoked trust and suspicion in historians. This book, by a distinguished team of specialists in Spartan history, is the first of a short series from CPW, approaching Spartan reality by way of close analysis of our main contemporary Greek sources: their access, their biases, the literary structure and the genre of their works.</p><p></p><h2>The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, A Tribute of the Nations</h2><p>News of Lincoln&#39;s assassination quickly spread across the globe and provoked an unparalleled outpouring of condolences. In the words of the citizens of the French city of Caen: There are crimes which shock and distress not one nation only, but the conscience of mankind. Hundreds of letters expressing this universal sympathy were directed to American ambassadors and envoys, the United States Congress, the newly inaugurated president, Andrew Johnson, and to the American people. On March 2, 1867, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives passed a joint resolution instructing that this correspondence be collected and there be printed for distribution by the Department of State, on fine paper, with wide margin, a sufficient number of copies to supply one copy to each senator and each representative of the Thirty-ninth Congress and to each foreign government, and one copy to each corporation, association, or public body, whose expressions of condolence or sympathy are published in said volume; one hundred of these copies to be bound in full Turkey morocco, full gilt, and the remaining copies to be bound in half Turkey morocco, marble edged. The totality of the correspondence that arrived from beyond the borders of the United States is reproduced in this volume for the first time since its original publication. It was considered at the time and remains an extraordinary tribute to the character and achievements of the sixteenth president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. In keeping with the original intent of the congress this edition is bound in bonded leather with gilt edges and a ribbon marker attached.</p><p></p><h2>The Stargate Conspiracy</h2><p>The authors of &#34;The Stargate Conspiracy&#34; aim to expose one of the most insidious and dangerous plans of our times. One that involves intelligence agencies, politicians, international bestselling authors, and the world&#39;s leading scientists and industrialists. They believe that this conspiracy, centred upon the eternal mysteries of ancient Egypt, targets and threatens us all. Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince highlight a secret agenda which has been pursued for nearly 50 years and which is emerging in the form of a hybrid fundamentalism on the eve of the Millennium. Tracing the identity of the groups involved and their pedigree through occult networks and mind-control experiments, the authors argue that at the heart of this conspiracy is the belief that ancient Egyptian gods were - and are - real extrterrestrial beings, that certain key people are in contact with these beings, and that they are about to return through the &#34;stargate&#34; between our world and theirs. The authors reveal that the background to these ideas can be found within astonishingly advanced scientific knowledge encapsulated in the ancient Egyptian texts, now recognized as a major influence on the development of European thought. The US-funded excavations that have taken place on the Giza plateua since the 1970s - offically denied, but for which Picknett and Prince produce documented evidence - now appear to be the result of directives allegedly received through communication with beings of higher intelligence, who are instructing the conspirators to lay the foundations for great global changes. But are we really preparing for the return of the gods? And, if so, will we be expected to accept unquestioningly the conspirators as our spokesmen? Or is this an exercise in mass deception designed to ensure our support of the conspirators? As the powerful few feed on millennial tension, triumphantly persuading us they alone know how to talk to the gods, the authors intend their work as a serious warning to mankind.</p><p>Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince are researchers and lecturers on the paranormal and religious mysteries. Since 1989 they have worked together on the research that has produced three highly acclaimed books.Strange though it may seem, this is not the book we originally set out to write. In a sense, we are very surprised and not a little shaken to have found ourselves on the rock-strewn path that led, ultimately, to <b>The Stargate Conspiracy</b>. <p> We had intended to write a follow-up to our 1997 book <b>The Templar Revelation</b>, which argued that Christianity was essentially an offshoot of the ancient Egyptian religion of Isis and Osiris meaning that our culture is not <b>Judeo</b>-Christian at all, but <b>Egypto</b>-Christian. The implications were astonishingly far-reaching, but we also disclosed the most carefully hidden of all the secrets of the heretical Knights Templar in the most controversial revelation of the book namely, that they believed that John the Baptist was the true Messiah, and that Jesus was, to say the very least, his usurper. </p><p> Wanting to learn more about our civilization&#x2019;s Egyptian roots, we researched further into the ancient religion, and found ourselves examining the Pyramid Texts and the origin of Hermetic writings. The more we progressed, the more we realized the ancient Egyptians possessed astonishing knowledge, far beyond that generally accepted by modern academics. We discovered that those far-off people had an understanding of cosmology unequalled until our own century, and even now perhaps they still have something to teach us. But in the end even the largely unknown and unacknowledged genius of the ancient Egyptians was not to be the subject of the book. </p><p> As non-academics researching ancient Egypt we could not remain unaware of the upsurge of interest in the &#x2018;alternative Egypt&#x2019; of Andrew Collins, Colin Wilson and others, whose books challenge the often rather complacent &#x2018;certainties&#x2019; of mainstream Egyptology. Above all three authors have become associated in the public mind with radical new ideas about ancient cultures, particularly Egypt: Robert Temple, author of the seminal <b>The Sirius Mystery</b> (1976); Robert Bauval, co-author with Adrian Gilbert of <b>The Orion Mystery</b> (1994); and Graham Hancock, whose runaway success was established with <b>The Sign and the Seal</b> (1992). Since then Hancock has gone on to entrance huge audiences worldwide with <b>Fingerprints of the Gods</b> (1995) and, with his wife Santha Faiia, <b>Heaven&#x2019;s Mirror</b> (1998), and also collaborating with Robert Bauval to produce <b>Keeper of Genesis</b> (1996) and (together with John Grigsby) <b>The Mars Mystery</b> (1998). These books encompass a vast range of fascinating and radical new ideas, many of which have now become so entrenched among their readers as to be accepted as hard fact. And, like most of their readers, we, too, began as enthralled admirers. </p><p> After many months of researching and writing this book, we still admired those authors&#x2019; energy and commitment, but as we stood back from their work, we have perceived a new and considerably larger pattern taking shape. Whether or not those authors are aware of it, their work forms an intrinsic part of what amounts to an orchestrated campaign. </p><p> And the matter does not end there. The bitter controversy surrounding the idea of a long-dead civilization on Mars has also been absorbed into this campaign and like the mysteries of Egypt has been pressed into service to present a carefully stage-managed message. Essentially, it proposes that the ancient gods were extraterrestrials <b>and they&#x2019;re back</b>. But the subtext is very clever: only certain, chosen people hear their words, and only certain chosen people will be part of the revelations to come. We can hazard a guess at the identity of some of the chosen, but the others may be rather surprising. </p><p> This is the well-worn tactic of &#x2018;divide and rule,&#x2019; and has worrying, quasi-religious overtones. And it is no obscure and tiny cult, but a massive phenomenon that, in one shape or form, has infiltrated much of the West&#x2019;s cultural and spiritual life. But who lies behind it? And what on earth would anyone hope to gain by it? </p><p> We certainly considered the idea that we may have developed into sad cases of paranoia the thought was to recur several times as we plunged deeper into this investigation but the evidence remains, staring us all in the face, and there is no doubt in our minds that a huge conspiracy is trying to make us think in certain ways. And for such a global plot to work, it requires teams of fellow conspirators, whose participation may be unwitting or otherwise. These groups, we were to find, not only included, rather predictably perhaps, intelligence agencies such as the CIA and MI5, but also less obvious candidates, from New Age gurus to cutting-edge physicists, top-level scientists and multimillionaires. </p><p> Cynically exploiting our <b>fin de si�cle</b> hunger for signs and wonders, and our ongoing love affair with the mysteries of ancient Egypt, the conspirators are in the process of creating a massive, insidious belief system that feeds on millennium fever, though perhaps not blossoming properly until the first years of the twenty-first century. </p><p> The fact that modern man&#x2019;s craving for contact with the numinous and the ineffable is being cynically exploited on a vast scale does not mean that there are never genuine paranormal phenomena or mystical experiences. Nor do we suggest that there are no mysteries about man&#x2019;s ancient past or his place in the universe. While we are critical of certain beliefs and claims to have solved some of those mysteries, it is because we find fault with them, not because we have a &#x2018;skeptical&#x2019; bias. What disturbs us greatly is the use to which many otherwise innocent or uplifting beliefs and concepts are being put. </p><p> Even the lives of those with no interest in such subjects will inevitably be touched my this campaign to have us believe and be persuaded to think in a certain way. We came to realize, with heavy hearts, that part of this plot is to prepare us to accept certain ideas that we would normally find unacceptable, perhaps even repugnant. Make no mistake, this amounts to cultural and spiritual brainwashing on a lavish scale. </p><p> This story is so challenging that we can only ask for a willing suspension of disbelief, and for our readers to follow our detective work step by step, abandoning preconceptions and personal biases along the way. At the end, perhaps the thought might be allowed: what <b>if</b> this book is right? What <b>if</b> there really is a &#x2018;stargate conspiracy&#x2019; eating away at the heart of democracy, human autonomy and decency itself? What <b>if</b> we are being prepared for the acceptance of something that we would normally find, to say the least, disturbing? </p><p> This book is not an attempt to rally the masses or create some kind of political backlash against the conspiracy. Perhaps, in any case, those with vested interests would ensure that such an attempt would be doomed to ignominious and immediate failure. Yet we believe that successful opposition <b>is</b> possible, beginning with the realization that, perhaps like the stargate itself, true resistance is in the mind. </p><p> </p><p> Reprinted from The Stargate Conspiracy by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince by permission of Berkley, a member of Penguin Putnam Inc.

Tragically, he died in an jungle aircraft crash in 1944. Like his famous kinsman Lawrence of Arabia, Wingate was renowned for being an unorthodox soldier, inclined to reject received patterns of military thought. He was a fundamentalist Christian with a biblical certainty in himself and his mission.<br><br>He is best-remembered as the charismatic and abrasive leader of the Chindits. With the support of Wavell, he was responsible for a strategy of using independent groups deep behind enemy limes, supported only by air drops. Wingate was responsible for leading the charge of 2,000 Ethiopians and the Sudan Defense Force into Italian-occupied Abyssinia. Remarkably, he defeated a 40,000 strong enemy that was supported by aircraft and artillery, which Wingate did not possess.<br><br>Despite his achievements, Wingate suffered from illness and depression and in Cairo attempted suicide. He was not universally liked: his romantic Zionism contrasted with the traditional British Arabist notions. He did, however, lead from the front and marched, ate and slept with his men.

A young man who returns to 1940s Cajun country to teach visits a black youth on death row for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. Together they come to understand the heroism of resisting.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, September 1997</b>: In a small Cajun community in 1940s Louisiana, a young black man is about to go to the electric chair for murder. A white shopkeeper had died during a robbery gone bad; though the young man on trial had not been armed and had not pulled the trigger, in that time and place, there could be no doubt of the verdict or the penalty.<p> "I was not there, yet I was there. No, I did not go to the trial, I did not hear the verdict, because I knew all the time what it would be..." So begins Grant Wiggins, the narrator of Ernest J. Gaines's powerful exploration of race, injustice, and resistance, <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i>. If young Jefferson, the accused, is confined by the law to an iron-barred cell, Grant Wiggins is no less a prisoner of social convention. University educated, Grant has returned to the tiny plantation town of his youth, where the only job available to him is teaching in the small plantation church school. More than 75 years after the close of the Civil War, antebellum attitudes still prevail: African Americans go to the kitchen door when visiting whites and the two races are rigidly separated by custom and by law. Grant, trapped in a career he doesn't enjoy, eaten up by resentment at his station in life, and angered by the injustice he sees all around him, dreams of taking his girlfriend Vivian and leaving Louisiana forever. But when Jefferson is convicted and sentenced to die, his grandmother, Miss Emma, begs Grant for one last favor: to teach her grandson to die like a man.</p><p> As Grant struggles to impart a sense of pride to Jefferson before he must face his death, he learns an important lesson as well: heroism is not always expressed through action--sometimes the simple act of resisting the inevitable is enough. Populated by strong, unforgettable characters, Ernest J. Gaines's <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i> offers a lesson for a lifetime.</p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>I&#39;ll Pass for Your Comrade: Women Soldiers in the Civil War</h2><p>The Civil War has been studied, written about, even sun about for generations. Most people know that it was a conflict between North and South, Unionists and rebels, blue and gray. We recognize the names of Jefferson Davis, Ulysses S. Grant, and Robert E. Lee. Many people know about Clara Barton, the nurse who did so much to save soldiers&#39; lives. But few have heard of Sarah Emma Edmonds, Rosetta Wakeman, or Mary Galloway. They were among the hundreds of women who assumed male identities, put on uniforms, enlisted in the Union or Confederate Army, and went into battle alongside their male comrades. In this compelling book, Anita Silvey explores the fascinating secret world of women soldiers: who they were, why they went to war, how they managed their masquerade. A few left memoirs, diaries, or letters. Newspaper stories, pension records, and regimental accounts yielded additional information, as did the writings of male soldiers who became aware of the women in the ranks. Undoubtedly, there were women soldiers whose true identity was never discovered or revealed. Accessible, accurate, and engaging, I&#39;ll Pass for Your Comrade invites readers to view the Civil War from an uncommon perspective and explores an often overlooked aspect of our history.</p><p>Anita Silvey has spent more than thirty years in the children's book field, including eleven years as editor-in-chief at the Horn Book Magazine. She is the editor of <i>Children&#x2019;s Books and Their Creators</i> and the author of <i>100 Best Books for Children</i> and&nbsp;<i>The Book-a-Day Almanac</i>."In her first book for young readers, children's literature expert Silvey introduces unsung heroes of the Civil War: women who risked their reputations and lives to fight as soldiers.&nbsp; The volume, containing excerpts from first-person accounts and abundant vintage photographs and etchings, explores the motives, adventures and day-to-day struggles of women who shed their skirts and cut their hair to pass as male enlistees.&nbsp; In highly accessible language, the author shares enough background to enable readers to put into context pre-Victorian restrictions on women.&nbsp; At the same time, she captures the fiery spirits of unconventional individuals.&nbsp; Representing more than 30 years of the author's passionate interest in the Civil War, Silvey's is an engrossing, intelligently wrought account of 19th-century feminists making their mark."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, <b>starred review</b>&nbsp;"While previous books for young people have profiled women who served as nurses and spies during the Civil War, this one spotlights Union and Confederate women who fought on the battlefields.&nbsp; Why these women fought; what their lives were like; how they hid their identities; how they fared in hospitals, in prisons, and in two significant battles; and what they did after the war ended are all topics that are covered.&nbsp; Readers will appreciate attention to mundane questions such as how women with so little privacy dealt with menstruation.&nbsp; Throughout the book, Silvey shows that though the women discussed all fought in the same war, their backgrounds, motivations, and experiences varied widely.&nbsp; Period photos, prints, drawings, and documents are among the many illustrations.&nbsp; Back matter includes source notes and a list of books, articles, and archival materials.&nbsp; Well researched and clearly written, this attractive book illuminates an aspect of the Civil War that is often overlooked."--<i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;"Silvey carefully documents a little-known side to the Civil War:&nbsp; the hundreds of women who fought for both sides.&nbsp; Some worked in traditional positions such as camp laundresses and only picked up arms when unexpectedly under fire, but this narrative focuses on women who posed as men in order to fight.&nbsp; Some did so to remain with a beloved husband or brother, but others sought glory, excitement or simply the chance to make money.&nbsp; The large number of boys in the armies made it relatively easy for women to "pass."&nbsp; Many fought well; some died in battle.&nbsp; A few even received pensions in their old age.&nbsp; Beginning with Bull Run, the neatly organized text explores the reasons for enlisting, how the women went about it, life as a soldier, Antietam, hospitals and prisons and, finally, what happened to them afterward.&nbsp; Folding in quotations from a wealth of primary sources and punctuated by period illustrations and photographs, the narrative takes readers to the battlefields for an immediate experience of combat.&nbsp; A valuable resource."--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;"Women's history continues to be a burgeoning field, especially the study of women who fought in the Civil War.&nbsp; Silvey offers insights into the soldiers' daily lives in hospitals and prisons and on the battlefields, including Antietam and Bull Run.&nbsp; Interjected into this brief survey are the stories of the women, some of whom joined the military, both Union and Confederate, to follow their husbands or sweethearts, and others who were passionate about the cause and wanted to defend their homeland.&nbsp; Still others wanted adventure or wished to escape from poverty.&nbsp; Lieutenant Harry T. Buford was, in fact, Loreta Janeta Velazquez and served as a Confederate officer at the First Battle of Bull Run.&nbsp; Sarah Emma Edmonds, born in Canada, left a harsh farm life and enlisted in the Michigan Volunteers.&nbsp; Jennie Hodgers served for three years as a member of an Illinois infantry unit and continued to live as a man for the next 40 years.&nbsp; Her true identify was not discovered until her death in 1911; nonetheless she was buried with full military honors.&nbsp; These are a few of the intriguing stories told in this well-researched book.&nbsp; Another highlight of the book is the use of archival photographs and reproductions.&nbsp; This title can serve as a springboard for further reading and inspire exploration of primary accounts."--<i>School Library Journal</i>&nbsp;"Female Civil War soldiers (disguised as men) weren't as rare as the history books might have you think.&nbsp; Former <i>Horn Book </i>editor Silvey's first book for young people explores this little-known chapter of history with numerous primary source references and thought-provoking commentary.&nbsp; Why did these women fight?&nbsp; How did they pass as men?&nbsp; How did they hold up to the daily life of a soldier . . . and the heat of the battlefield?&nbsp; And how did these remarkable women transition back into civilian life after the war?&nbsp; Given the relative dearth of material on female Civil War soldiers, it's to Silvey's credit that she is able to build an engaging social history in answer to these questions, interspersing solid factual exposition with colorful vignettes and period illustrations and photographs.&nbsp; The broader contexts of the war and the societal mores of the time give additional resonance to this well-researched portrait of brave, unconventional women.&nbsp; As Loreta Janeta Velazquez reminisced, "I would not have missed it for the wealth of the world, and was more than repaid for all that I had undergone, and all the risks to my person and my womanly reputation that I incurred, in being not only a spectator, but an actor, in such a sublime, living drama."--<i>The Horn Book</i>&nbsp;</p><h2>Berlioz and His Century: An Introduction to the Age of Romanticism</h2><p>In this abridgment of his monumental study, <i>Berlioz and the Romantic Century</i>, Jacques Barzun recounts the events and extraordinary achievements of the great composer's life against the background of the romantic era. As the author eloquently demonstrates, Berloiz was an archetype whose destiny was the story of an age, the incarnation of an artistic style and a historical spirit. "In order to understand the nineteenth century, it is essential to understand Berlioz," notes W. H. Auden, "and in order to understand Berlioz, it is essential to read Professor Barzun."</p><p><b>Jacques Barzun</b>, University Professor Emeritus at Columbia, is the author of the classic <i>Teacher in America </i>and <i>The American University</i>. His books published by the University of Chicago Press include<i> On Writing, Editing, and Publishing; Classic, Romantic, and Modern; The House of Intellect; A Stroll with William James</i>; and <i>Begin Here</i>.</p><h2>Halloween Tree, The</h2><p>A group of boys dressed in Halloween costumes visit a deserted house where they discover a mysterious pumpkin tree</p><p>Special indeed are holiday stories with the right mix of high spirits and subtle mystery to please both adults and children--Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol," for example. Or Ray Bradbury's classic <i>The Halloween Tree</i>. Eight boys set out on a Halloween night and are led into the depths of the past by a tall, mysterious character named Moundshroud. They ride on a black wind to autumn scenes in distant lands and times, where they witness other ways of celebrating this holiday about the dark time of year. Bradbury's lyrical prose whooshes along with the pell-mell rhythms of children running at night, screaming and laughing, and the reader is carried along by its sheer exuberance. <p> Bradbury's stories about children are always attended by dread--of change, adulthood, death. <i>The Halloween Tree</i>, while sweeter than his adult literature, is also touched at moments by the cold specter of loss--which is only fitting, of course, for a holiday in honor of the waning of the sun. </p><p> This is a superb book for adults to read to children, a way to teach them, quite painlessly, about customs and imagery related to Halloween from ancient Egypt, Mediterranean cultures, Celtic Druidism, Mexico, and even a cathedral in Paris. (One caveat, though: Bradbury unfortunately perpetuates a couple of misconceptions about <i>Samhain</i>, or summer's end, the Halloween of ancient Celts and contemporary pagans.) This beautiful reprint edition has the original black-and-white illustrations and a new color painting on the dust jacket. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>"At last someone has written a book about Halloween that is tricky and scary, ghostly and windy, deathly and clammy"<br>-- The Boston Globe<p>"Imaginatively cryptic...skillfully presented."<br>-- The Los Angeles Times</p><p>"A spectacular guide to the nether regions."<br>-- Kirkus</p><p>"There is a great treat in Bradbury's frenetic imagery."<br>-- The New York Times</p></p><h2>First-Time: The Historical Vision of an Afro-American People (Johns Hopkins Studies in Atlantic History and Culture)</h2><p>A classic of historical anthropology, First-Time traces the shape of historical thought among peoples who had previously been denied any history at all. Each page of the book presents a transcript of oral histories told by living Saramakas about their eighteenth-century ancestors along with commentary from Price that places their accounts into a broader historical context.</p><p><p>Richard Price is the author of twelve books, including an earlier work on the Saramaka people, the award-winning First Time: The Historical Vision of an Afro-American People. He is coeditor, with Sally Price, of John Gabriel Steadman's Narrative of a Five Year Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam.

Unlike other genres, world music spans so huge a territory (the world) that there are surprises and new pleasures for everyone. The table of contents sets the tone. Laid out as a map of the world, the chapters are located directly on the map. This is followed, however, by a traditional table of contents, laid out in linear 1 to 13 format for those who don't go for the visual approach. However you chose your dive-in point, you won't be disappointed. A tremendous amount of work has gone into this guide, covering a remarkable number of subgenres and groups. Search for a group you've heard of, read up on a specific genre like klezmer or flamenco, get CD recommendations, or troll for new finds like Altan, the Irish band of the '90s, and Ibrahim Tatlises, the premier Kurdish performer. There's a wealth of sounds out there that Rough Guide makes accessible. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i>Popular music is drawing inspiration from literally the four corners of the earth, in turn creating a pool of listeners for the artists of those countries. The <i>Virgin Directory of World Music</i> [<i>RBB</i> Ja 1 93] began introducing listeners to them, and now authors of the Rough Guide travel series have expanded on the theme. Divided into regional chapters and then subregions, the text explores the history of indigenous or traditional music and its current status and permutations. Individual bands and performers are described within the text, and such performers as Mari Boine, a Sami performer, and King Sunny Ade{&#x201a;} of Nigeria are highlighted in sidebars. Other sidebars cover special instruments such as the Uillean pipes, genres such as Taarab, glossaries of important terms, or lists of festivals. Annotated discographies end each subsection. Some countries not included in the narrative are given space in the discographies (e.g., Denmark). The text has a breezy conversational flow. Topics covered range from India's movie-music industry to Hungarian and Gypsy music to Klezmer's comeback. Black-and-white photographs, both historic and contemporary, dot the book. The guide's closing information includes a list of the credentials of contributors and an index. There isn't a bibliography, because much of the information was gathered while the contributors traveled, which also accounts for the personal flavor of the entries.<p><i>World Music</i> works well to update the smaller <i>Virgin Directory</i>, the author of which is also a contributor to the new work. This highly readable book will prove popular in high-school, public, and undergraduate libraries. <i></i></p></p><h2>Measure Twice: Tips and tricks from the pros to help you avoid the most common DIY disasters</h2><p><p><strong>Canada's #1 expert on DIY simplifies Canada's most common (and avoidable) DIY disasters.</strong><br><br>DIY projects seem quick and easy.

She has been a popular speaker on writing and publishing topics for Poets &amp; Writers, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and for countless writer conferences from New York to Maui. Katharine has worked with a varied list of authors who publish a diverse array of books including fiction, memoir and nonfiction.Here's a very useful book for first-time writers. Most how-to books for writers deal with this important subject (finding an agent) in a chapter or two, but Sands, a literary agent in New York, shows that there's a lot more to it than one might expect. Drawing on the experience of a variety of agents (plus one copywriter), she demonstrates that finding an agent involves finding the perfect match between author and representative, between material and market. Think it's easy to write a query letter? Think again: agents get a lot of mail, and you only have one chance to get their attention. Think it's easy to put together a book proposal? Try it sometime, but try not to be too wordy, or too self-promoting, or too been-there-done-that. Do your homework, Sands stresses: don't pitch a genre novel to an agent who deals primarily in nonfiction; do know what other books cover the same ground as yours. But, above all, do read this book, which should teach you pretty much everything you'll need to know. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

James Reid, Queen Victoria's personal physician for over 20 years, eventually became one of the most influential men in England and a channel of communication between the Queen and the government. An intimate member of the royal household, he helped extricate Victoria from many muddles and household crises, while he himself enjoyed the friendship of exiled Empress Eugenie, Kaiser Wilhelm and others in the Queen's extended family of European royalty. Drawing on Reid's diaries and other unpublished materials, the wife of his grandson here reconstructs an engaging picture of the relationship of the young Scottish doctor and the aging monarch. As he catered to Victoria's foibles and minor ailments, Reid won her trust and the favor that resulted in knighthood, although, even as a practicing physician, he never saw his royal patient undressed until she was dead.

While his more vocal rivals sometimes grabbed the headlines, Pete always preferred to let his racket do the talking.<br> <br> Until now.<br> <br> In <i>A Champion&#x2019;s Mind</i>, the tennis great who so often exhibited visible discomfort with letting people &#x201c;inside his head&#x201d; finally opens up. An athletic prodigy, Pete resolved from his earliest playing days never to let anything get in the way of his love for the game. But while this single-minded determination led to tennis domination, success didn&#x2019;t come without a price. The constant pressure of competing on the world&#x2019;s biggest stage&#x2014;in the unblinking eye of a media machine hungry for more than mere athletic greatness&#x2014;took its toll. <br> <br> Here for the first time Pete speaks freely about what it was like to possess what he calls &#x201c;the Gift.&#x201d; He writes about the personal trials he faced&#x2014;including the death of a longtime coach and confidant&#x2014;and the struggles he gutted his way through while being seemingly on top of the world. Among the book&#x2019;s most riveting scenes are an early devastating loss to Stefan Edberg that led Pete to make a monastic commitment to delivering on his natural talent; a grueling, four-hour-plus match against Alex Corretja during which Pete became seriously ill; fierce on-court battles with rival and friend Andre Agassi; and the triumphant last match of Pete&#x2019;s career at the finals of the 2002 U.S. Open.<br> <br> In <i>A Champion&#x2019;s Mind</i>, one of the most revered, successful, and intensely private players in the history of tennis offers an intimate look at the life of an elite athlete.</p><p>PETE SAMPRAS holds the distinction of being the youngest male player (at age nineteen) to win the U.S. Open. During his career he won sixty-four top-level singles titles (including fourteen Grand Slams, eleven ATP Masters Series titles, and five Tennis Masters Cup titles) as well as two doubles titles. Currently he makes his home in Los Angeles with his wife, Bridgette, and their sons, Christian and Ryan.<br><br>PETER BODO is a senior editor and chief columnist at <i>Tennis</i> magazine.Handsome and talented tennis champion Pete Sampras always preferred to let his racket do the talking. His memoir finally allows tennis fans into the life of this elite athlete. Written in a strictly chronological order, the material includes some stories that belie the calm that Sampras always tried to show on the court. His first meetings with his wife are rather humorous. The descriptions of his matches against Andre Agassi remain as compelling to hear as they were to watch. Narrator Mark Deakins delivers a straightforward narration with no vocal characterizations and tightly controlled energy. Listeners may get the feeling this audio presentation is exactly like watching a Pete Sampras tennis match: perfectly executed, occasionally exciting, sometimes interesting, but rather unemotional.

The combination of the two cultures works well; each story in this eclectic collection begs to be read aloud: "Long before time wound its watch and started ticking and chasing after tomorrow, which it can never catch up to, well, that was the time when Dog and Cat were friends." Lester's retellings are beguiling and graceful, his language attuned to each story's nuances. Shannon's striking paintings, in rich browns and greens, are as full of depth as the stories themselves. Particularly interesting are "The Wonderful Healing Leaves," a stirring tale of bravery handsomely rewarded, and "What Is the Most Important Part of the Body?," an African/Jewish tale in which a Queen and King learn what all storytellers must know: that they must use "their tongues for good. May we do the same." Ages 7-11. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Witness of the Stars</h2><p>This book is a treasure from the annals of history.

So their son could spend his Tuesday nights drinking beer, smoking dope, eating weird food, and learning to see the assassin's side of the story?"<p> Yup, that's the way it was, and Perrotta's immense strength is to give moment-by-moment immediacy to his hero's tortuous internal monologue. Instead of dumping his Jersey girl, Danny figures, "if I avoided her long enough, she'd get tired of waiting and supply my half of the conversation on her own, thereby sparing me the unpleasantness of having to be the bad guy." Yet he is also capable of heroism, as when he impulsively defies no-neck Mafiosi who menace his dad's "Roach Coach" lunch truck, which Danny drives to blue-collar work sites during school breaks. What gives the story structure is the collision in our hero's soul between his former life and the world of towers, moats, and upward mobility. He can't quite identify with his hometown reverence for Bruce Springsteen, but it rubs him wrong to see Springsteen LPs played "for the enjoyment of people who were going to end up being the bosses of the people the Boss was singing about. Nobody in Entryway C was born to run."</p><p> <i>Election</i> may have a better plot, but <i>Joe College</i> scoots along like a waterskeeter on a marvelous stream of consciousness.

Brilliantly witty, charged with charm, a "born writer," she drenched her prodigious talents in liquids, burnt up her opportunities in flamboyant affairs, and died as she lived&#x2014;repeating her uncle's history of excess, collapse, and ruin. In this biography, Joan Schenkar has created both a captivating portrait of Dolly and a cultural history of Natalie Clifford Barney's remarkable Parisian salon&#x2014;frequented by Janet Flanner, Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes&#x2014;in which she shone so brightly.</p><p>She was lovely, sophisticated, and famous for her witty conversation, even in a social circle that was known for its fabulous talkers. The only child of Oscar Wilde's dissipated older brother Willie, Dolly Wilde (1895-1941) led a life as scandalous and glittering as her uncle's: she, too, loved her own sex, and her longest romantic relationship was with American heiress Natalie Clifford Barney, who was host of the most important Parisian literary salon of the 20th century. Unfortunately for Dolly's posthumous reputation, she "was an artist of the spoken word" whose only written legacy was her marvelous correspondence. Quoting liberally and perceptively from those letters, American playwright Joan Schenkar brings Wilde to life in a modernist biography that is written in prose as sparkling as Dolly's fabled <i>bons mots</i>. Schenkar eschews conventional chronology to consider Wilde's life thematically, from her lesbianism to her taste for smart society to her self-destructive identification with Uncle Oscar. She reminds us just how remarkable and accomplished were the women at Barney's salon (journalist Janet Flanner, novelist Djuna Barnes, and artist Mina Loy, among them) and how much they esteemed Dolly Wilde. Yet, her biographer downplays neither Wilde's addiction to drugs nor the sad loneliness of her death (possibly from a drug overdose) at age 45. This is essentially a tale of "squandered gifts and lost opportunities," Schenkar acknowledges, but she successfully provokes readers to share her admiration for Wilde's prodigal generosity with both her talent and her affections. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Joan Schenkar</b> has been called "America's most original contemporary playwright" and her work has been produced throughout the world.

E. B. Du Bois, Virginia Woolf, Frank McCourt and Katharine Graham--the author suggests why it is that we are so drawn to the reading of autobiography, and she illuminates the cultural assumptions behind the ways in which we talk about ourselves. <br>Conway traces the narrative patterns typically found in autobiographies by men to the tale of the classical Greek hero and his epic journey of adventure. She shows how this configuration evolved, in memoirs, into the passionate romantic struggling against the conventions of society, into the frontier hero battling the wilderness, into self-made men overcoming economic obstacles to create an invention or a fortune--or, more recently, into a quest for meaning, for an understandable past, for an ethnic identity.<br>In contrast, she sees the designs that women commonly employ for their memoirs as evolving from the writings of the mystics--such as Dame Julian of Norwich or St. Teresa of Avila--about their relationship with an all-powerful God. As against the male autobiographer's expectation of power over his fate, we see the woman memoirist again and again believing that she lacks command of her destiny, and tending to censor her own story.<br>Throughout, Conway underlines the memoir's magic quality of allowing us to enter another human being's life and mind--and how this experience enlarges and instructs our own lives.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>"Why," asks Jill Ker Conway, "is autobiography the most popular form of fiction for modern readers?" As the author of two stellar memoirs--<i>The Road from Coorain</i> and <i>True North</i>--Conway would seem superbly qualified to answer her own question. Her initial premise is that naturalistic fiction has lost much of its power to enchant, that the cynical readers of our fin de siecle are unwilling to suspend their disbelief for a run-of-the-mill storyteller. Only the memoirist's factual frolics can truly engage us and satisfy our craving to be "allowed <i>inside</i> the experience of another person who really lived and who tells about experiences which did in fact occur." <p> This clear-cut distinction between the two forms is, of course, highly dubious, and Conway is quick to acknowledge the rather porous nature of autobiographical "truth." In fact, she argues, all memoirs tend to conform to certain narrative patterns. What's more, Conway classifies these patterns along gender lines: men produce epic adventures, in which the testosterone-driven protagonist battles against nature and society for control of his fate, while women are quicker to record the trials of domestic life and evolving consciousness. Conway draws on the entire history of autobiography for her discussion, from Saint Augustine and Germaine Greer to Vanessa Bell and Frank McCourt. (But what happened to Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Speak, Memory</i>, a title Conway echoes in her own?) At times her subjects stubbornly refuse to conform to the appropriate, his-and-hers pattern--suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst's <i>My Own Story</i>, for example, has the manly sound of "a series of communiques from a general in the field." Yet Conway's trawl through the history of the genre is full of brilliant insights as well as less known autobiographical gems, and no memoir-mad reader will want to miss it.</p>Jill Ker Conway grew up in Australia, graduated from the University of Sydney in 1958 and received her Ph.D. from Harvard in 1969. From 1964 to 1975 she taught at the University of Toronto and was vice president there before serving for ten years as president of Smith College. Since 1985 she has been a visiting scholar and professor in M.I.T.'s Program in Science, Technology, and Society.

The real catastrophies are always unimagined, unprepared for, unknown. What if our 24-hour day grew longer, first in minutes, then in hours, until day becomes night and night becomes day? What effect would this slowing have on the world?</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2012</strong>: In <em>The Age of Miracles</em>, the world is ending not with a bang so much as a long, drawn-out whimper. And it turns out the whimper can be a lot harder to cope with. The Earth's rotation slows, gradually stretching out days and nights and subtly affecting the planet's gravity. The looming apocalypse parallels the adolescent struggles of 10-year-old Julia, as her comfortable suburban life succumbs to a sort of domestic deterioration. Julia confronts her parents' faltering marriage, illness, the death of a loved one, her first love, and her first heartbreak. Karen Thompson Walker is a gifted storyteller. Her language is precise and poetic, but style never overpowers the realism she imbues to her characters and the slowing Earth they inhabit. Most impressively, Thompson Walker has written a coming-of-age tale that asks whether it's worth coming of age at all in a world that might end at any minute. Like the best stories about the end of the world, <em>The Age of Miracles</em> is about the existence of hope and whether it can prevail in the face of uncertainty. --<em>Kevin Nguyen</em></p> <p><b>Q&amp;A with Karen Thompson Walker</b></p> <p><strong>Q. In <em>The Age of Miracles, </em>you envision a natural phenomenon that threatens the entire world. This "slowing" is global, yet you decided to focus on Julia. Why?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Julia's voice--the voice of a young woman looking back on her adolescence--came into my head as soon as I had the idea of the slowing. It was the only way I could imagine writing the book. Adolescence is an extraordinary time of life, a period when the simple passage of time results in dramatic consequences, when we grow and change at seemingly impossible speeds. It seemed natural to tell the story of the slowing, which is partly about time, in the context of middle school. It was also a way of concentrating on the fine-grain details of everyday life, which was very important to me. I was interested in exploring the ways in which life carries on, even in the face of profound uncertainty.</p> <p>Julia felt like a natural narrator for this story because she listens more than she speaks, and she watches more than she acts. I think the fact that Julia is an only child is part of why she's so observant. Julia also places a very high value on her friendships, and is unusually attuned to the subtle tensions in her parents' marriage, which increase as the slowing unfolds.</p> <p><strong>Q. The details of how such a slowing would affect us and our environment are rendered quite realistically. How did you get these details right? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>No one knows exactly what would happen if the rotation of the earth slowed the way it does in my book, so I had some freedom. I did some research at the outset, but I came across many of my favorite details accidentally. Whenever I read an article that contained a potentially relevant detail--anything from sleep disorders, to new technologies for growing plants in greenhouses, to the various ways people and governments reacted to the financial crisis--I would knit it into the fabric of the book. After I finished the book, I had an astrophysicist read it for scientific accuracy, which was an extremely nerve-racking experience. I was relieved by how many of my details he found plausible, but made some adjustments based on what he said.</p> <p>In general, I wanted my book to seem as real as possible. I recently read a <em>Guardian</em> interview with the Portuguese writer Jos� Saramago, who said that his books were about "the possibility of the impossible." He explained that even if the premise of a book seemed "impossible," it was important to him that the development of that premise be logical and rational. That's exactly the way I wanted <em>The Age of Miracles</em> to function.</p> <p><strong>Q. Like Julia, you grew up in Southern California, where natural disasters are always looming. Do you think this influenced you in writing of <em>The Age of Miracles</em>?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>I grew up in San Diego on a cul-de-sac of tract houses much like the one where <em>The Age of Miracles</em> takes place. In most ways, California was a very pleasant place to grow up. But it could also be a little scary. I remember how the sky would sometimes fill with smoke during fire season, how the smoke hung in the air for days at a time, burning our throats and turning everything slightly orange. I remember the way the windows rattled at the start of every earthquake, and the way the chandelier above our dinner table would swing back and forth until the shaking stopped. I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, worried that an earthquake or a fire would strike at night. But when I think of those years now, I realize that my novel grew partly out of my lifelong habit of imagining disaster.</p> <p>If I've given the impression that I was constantly afraid as a child, that's not right. In fact, one of the things I remember most vividly about living in California is the way we mostly ignored the possibility of danger. We always knew that the "big one"--the giant earthquake that scientists believe will one day hit the region--could strike at any time, but mostly we lived as if it never would. Life often felt idyllic: We played soccer, we went swimming, we went walking on the beach. A little bit of denial is part of what it means to live in California. Then again, maybe that's also just part of being alive. I really wanted to capture that feeling in <em>The Age of Miracles.</em></p>Karen Thompson Walker is a graduate of UCLA and the Columbia MFA program.

In a prefatory note Winters says she has been somewhat less specific about her amatory exploits in this book, but she still relates affairs with Sterling Hayden, Sean Connery, and Albert Finney, among others, and adds some steamy episodes from her marriage with Tony Franciosa. Much of the fascination of the book stems from observing Winters's naive egocentricity, and wondering what scatterbrained thing she's going to do next. As usual, Winters is not too concerned with accuracy, but the readers who made her previous volume a best seller won't be disappointed by this entertaining follow-up.<br><i>- John Smothers, Monmouth Cty.

Rebelling against a stern grandmother who prohibited the use of spices, fats, alcohol and "the five senses" in the household, Fisher began "learning to live well gastronomically" around age six. She writes of spankings by her father, who had himself been physically abused as a child, and she divulges that for 25 years she imagined that a guardian spirit--a tiny ancient man--kept vigil under her bed while she slept. She rues her standoffish treatment of a Mexican classmate, revels in the "escape hatch" called San Francisco and describes a ring of girls who secretly disseminated sex information in boarding school.

With this book, Irene has given the world a deeply personal account of her own family's experience that bravely reveals how much all the terrible losses of the Holocaust meant not just in World War II but, sadly, today as well.<em> -Jane Jarboe Russell, author, The Train To Crystal City </em></p><p> </p></p><h2>Brother Assassin (Berserker Series, Book 2)</h2><p>Time Operative Derron Odegard must stop the Berserkers&#39; death machines from traveling into the planet Sirgol&#39;s past and removing from history an individual responsible for the modern development of mankind</p><p>In addition to the popular Dracula Series,<b> Fred Saberhagen</b> is the author of the popular Berserker (tm) Series and the bestselling <i>Lost Swords </i>and <i>Book of Lost Swords</i>.

Out of his extensive research into manuscripts and primary sources and his conversations with friends in present-day Shaker communities has come a warm, illuminating history, the most thorough ever written on these pious, humble people and the distinct impression they made on American life.<br>The book opens with an introductory assessment of the Shaker contribution to the history of American social experimentation, as seen from the modern point of view. There follows the often amazing story of Ann Lee and the origins of the movement in eighteenth-century England, its emigration to New England, the early Shaker experiments in communism, and the expansion to the American West. The author then pauses to examine in detail the ideology behind the Shaker dedication to physical labor; Shaker industry and design, including a discussion of the spare, utilitarian folk art so popular today; the highly formalized mode of worship, with its lively songs and dances and its often violent emotionalism; strange manifestations during the revival periods of the 1830s and 40s; the rigid internal organization of the Shaker community and its original economic and sociological theories; Shaker relations with the outside world; and the decline of the sect after the Civil War.<br>This edition is the first to include the author&#x2019;s valuable notes, as well as the original appendixes containing the complete text of the Millennial Laws, a statistical breakdown of all the Shaker communities, and a bibliography. This material is especially useful to students of American social and religious movements, but the author&#x2019;s reliance upon original manuscript material and contemporary illustrations lend this book an exciting immediacy that makes it a pleasure for all readers interested in fascinating people and unique ways of life.<br>&#x201c;An excellent history of one of the most interesting of American religious cults.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Nation.<br></i>&#x201c;Satisfies the exacting standards of historical scholarship and promises at the same time to enlighten and hold the interest of the general reader.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Saturday Review.<br></i>&#x201c;A substantial contribution to American history.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>The New York Times.</i></p><p></p><h2>China&#39;s Dragon Robes</h2><p>This is a long-awaited reprint of the major work first published in 1952. China's Dragon Robes is a scholarly survey of the dragon-patterned robes worn by nobles and officials in China during the later dynasties. Intended as a source book on a major phase of Chinese costume, it is based on translations from many Chinese sources and on the author's personal studies of existing examples of dragon robes in the USA and in China. <p>Although many dragon robes have found their way into Western museums, the little information concerning them which has appeared in exhibition catalogs and monographs has been largely devoted to describing the robes as examples of fine textile works. Dr. Cammann here considers the evolution of the robes, their further development in the Qing dynasty, their function in their own times, their symbolism, the techniques employed in making them, including weaving and dyeing, and their place in Far Eastern culture in general. </p><p>The thoroughly documented and annotated text, supplemented by carefully chosen illustrations, offers museum curators, historians, and students of Oriental Art a basic discussion of an important, but hitherto neglected chapter in China's cultural history.</p></p><p></p><h2>Letter &amp; Spirit, Vol. 3: The Hermeneutic of Continuity: Christ, Kingdom, and Creation (Letter &amp; Spirit: A Journal of Catholic Biblical Theology)</h2><p>This is the third annual volume of the remarkably popular journal of biblical theology edited by Dr. Scott Hahn. This volume features important contributions by Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Christoph Schonborn, and Cardinal Avery Dulles. Also included are original and though-provoking contributions on such topics as: the biblical basis of indulgences; feminine and maternal images of the Holy Spirit in early Christianity; and the &#34;image of God&#34; doctrine in St. Thomas Aquinas&#39; writings. Hahn contributes a deep exploration of how the Gospel of Luke portrays Christ as the Davidic Messiah and the Church as the restoration of the Davidic kingdom.</p><p></p><h2>Pygmalion&#x2019;s Power: Romanesque Sculpture, the Senses, and Religious Experience</h2><p><p>Pushed to the height of its illusionistic powers during the first centuries of the Roman Empire, sculpture was largely abandoned with the ascendancy of Christianity, as the apparent animation of the material image and practices associated with sculpture were considered both superstitious and idolatrous. In <i>Pygmalion&#x2019;s Power</i>, Thomas E. A. Dale argues that the reintroduction of architectural sculpture after a hiatus of some seven hundred years arose with the particular goal of engaging the senses in a Christian religious experience. </p><p>Since the term &#x201c;Romanesque&#x201d; was coined in the nineteenth century, the reintroduction of stone sculpture around the mid-eleventh century has been explained as a revivalist phenomenon, one predicated on the desire to claim the authority of ancient Rome. In this study, Dale proposes an alternative theory. Covering a broad range of sculpture types&#x2014;including autonomous cult statuary in wood and metal, funerary sculpture, architectural sculpture, and portraiture&#x2014;Dale shows how the revitalized art form was part of a broader shift in emphasis toward spiritual embodiment and affective piety during the late eleventh and twelfth centuries.</p><p>Adding fresh insight to scholarship on the Romanesque, <i>Pygmalion&#x2019;s Power</i> borrows from trends in cultural anthropology to demonstrate the power and potential of these sculptures to produce emotional effects that made them an important sensory part of the religious culture of the era.</p></p><p><p><strong>Thomas E. A. Dale</strong> is Professor of Art History at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.</p>&#x201c;Dale describes a historical sea change in European Christianity at the end of the first millennium, evident in the formation of Romanesque sculpture, which he masterfully explores. <i>Pygmalion&#x2019;s Power</i> shows how the religious sense of embodiment condensed physically and metaphysically in this period and enabled a conception of vision whose materiality laid the groundwork for everything that followed in religious imagery and art. Dale&#x2019;s book makes a welcome contribution to the history of images, deftly bringing art, theology, devotional practice, and visual experience together in an account that deepens our understanding of Romanesque sculpture and its implications for the history of art and religion thereafter.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;David Morgan, author of <i>Images at Work: The Material Culture of Enchantment</i><br><br>&#x201c;The eleventh and twelfth centuries in Western Europe witnessed a level of sculptural production unequaled since antiquity. Thomas Dale offers a fresh and compelling account of this phenomenon, focusing on how the very materiality of Romanesque sculpture helped patrons and audiences make sense of their world. This book will be of wide interest to historians of medieval art, as well as to anyone interested in the problem of the senses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Kirk T. Ambrose, author of <i>The Marvellous and the Monstrous in the Sculpture of Twelfth-Century Europe</i><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Pygmalion&#x2019;s Power</i>, Thomas Dale replaces the outdated master narrative of Romanesque sculpture with a brilliant new history of materials, meanings, and functions. Considering both the normative&#x2014;portraiture and the ideal nude&#x2014;and the &#x2018;disruptive other&#x2019; of the monstrous and the lustful, he delves into issues of the body as model, as admonition, and even as musical instrument to be played rightly. Finally, characterizing the church itself as body, he demonstrates how sculpture could activate the senses and allow perception of the divine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Cynthia Hahn, author of <i>Strange Beauty: Issues in the Making and Meaning of Reliquaries, 400&#x2013;circa 1204</i><br><br>&#x201c;The reasons for sculpture&#x2019;s &#x2018;revival&#x2019; and its vital eventual role in the visual culture of the Middle Ages have long dogged the narrative of medieval art. Dale offers an original and thought-provoking rewriting of the problem by exploring sculpture&#x2019;s new spiritual embodiment, decisively showing how viewers&#x2019; psychological investment in sculptural objects&#x2014;stone sculpture in a cloister, reliquaries in crypts, carved wooden Crucifixions&#x2014;animated the works and gave them meaning. <i>Pygmalion&#x2019;s Power</i> represents a significant reorientation for medieval sculpture studies and offers a welcome challenge to older orthodoxies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Robert A.

Today I was watching it being dug back up.</p><p>My uncle Myron stood next to me. Tears ran down his face. His brother was in that coffin&#x2014;no, strike that, his brother was <i>supposed</i> to be in that coffin&#x2014;a brother who <i>supposedly</i> died eight months ago, but a brother Myron hadn&#x2019;t seen in twenty years.</p><p>We were at the B&#x2019;nai Jeshurun Cemetery in Los Angeles. It was not yet six in the morning, so the sun was just starting to rise. Why were we here so early? Exhuming a body, the authorities had explained to us, upsets people. You need to do it at a time of maximum privacy. That left late at night&#x2014;uh, no thank you&#x2014;or very early in the morning.</p><p>Uncle Myron sniffled and wiped his eye. He looked as though he wanted to put his arm around me, so I slid a little farther away. I stared down at the dirt. Eight months ago, the world had held such promise. After a lifetime of traveling overseas, my parents decided to settle back in the United States so that I, as a sophomore in high school, would finally have real roots and real friends.</p><p>It all changed in an instant. That was something I had learned the hard way. Your world doesn&#x2019;t come apart slowly. It doesn&#x2019;t gradually crumble or break into pieces. It can be destroyed in a snap of the fingers.</p><p>So what happened?</p><p>A car crash.</p><p>My father died, my mother fell apart, and in the end, I was made to live in New Jersey with my uncle, Myron Bolitar. Eight months ago, my mother and I came to this very cemetery to bury the man we loved like no other. We said the proper blessings. We watched as the coffin was lowered into the ground. I even threw ceremonial dirt on my father&#x2019;s grave.</p><p>It was the worst moment of my life.</p><p>&#x201c;Stand back, please.&#x201d;</p><p>It was one of graveyard workers. What did they call someone who worked in a graveyard? <i>Groundskeeper</i> seemed too tame. <i>Gravedigger</i> seemed too creepy. They had used a bulldozer to bring up most of the dirt. Now these two guys in overalls&#x2014;let&#x2019;s call them groundskeepers&#x2014;finished with their shovels.</p><p>Uncle Myron wiped the tears from his face. &#x201c;Are you okay, Mickey?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. I wasn&#x2019;t the one crying here. He was.</p><p>A man wearing a bow tie and holding a clipboard frowned and took notes. The two groundskeepers stopped digging. They tossed their shovels out the hole. The shovels landed with a <i>clank.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Done!&#x201d; one shouted. &#x201c;Securing it now.&#x201d;</p><p>They started shimmying nylon belts under the casket. This took some doing. I could hear their grunts of exertion. When they finished, they both jumped out of the hole and nodded toward the crane operator. The crane operator nodded back and pulled a lever.</p><p>My father&#x2019;s casket rose out of the earth.</p><p>It had not been easy to arrange this exhumation. There are so many rules and regulations and procedures. I don&#x2019;t really know how Uncle Myron pulled it off. He has a powerful friend, I know, who helped ease the way. I think maybe my best friend Ema&#x2019;s mother, the Hollywood star Angelica Wyatt, may have used her influence too. The details, I guess, aren&#x2019;t important. The important thing was, I was about to learn the truth.</p><p>You are probably wondering why we are digging up my father&#x2019;s grave.</p><p>That&#x2019;s easy. I needed to be sure that Dad was in there.</p><p>No, I don&#x2019;t think that there was a clerical error or that he was put in the wrong coffin or buried in the wrong spot. And, no, I don&#x2019;t think my dad is a vampire or a ghost or anything like that.</p><p>I suspect&#x2014;and, yes, it makes no sense at all&#x2014;that my father may still be alive.</p><p>It particularly makes no sense in my case because I was in that car when it crashed. I saw him die. I saw the paramedic shake his head and wheel my father&#x2019;s limp body away.</p><p>Of course, I had also seen that same paramedic try to kill me a few days ago.</p><p>&#x201c;Steady, steady.&#x201d;</p><p>The crane began to swing toward the left.</p><p>It lowered my father&#x2019;s casket onto the back of a pickup truck. His coffin was a plain pine box. This, I knew, my father would have insisted upon. Nothing fancy. My father wasn&#x2019;t religious, but he loved tradition.</p><p>After the coffin touched down with a quiet thud, the crane operator turned off the engine, jumped out, and hurried toward the man with the bow tie. The operator whispered something in the man&#x2019;s ear. Bow Tie looked back at him sharply. The crane operator shrugged and walked away.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think that was about?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Uncle Myron said.</p><p>I swallowed hard as we started toward the back of the pickup truck. Myron and I stepped in unison. That was a little weird. Both of us are tall&#x2014;six foot four inches. If the name Myron Bolitar rings a bell, that could be because you&#x2019;re a basketball fan. Before I was born, Myron was an All-American collegiate player at Duke and then was chosen in the first round of the NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. In his very first preseason game&#x2014;the first time he got to wear his Celtic green uniform&#x2014;an opposing player named Burt Wesson smashed into Myron, twisting my uncle&#x2019;s knee and ending his career before it began. As a basketball player myself&#x2014;one who hopes to surpass his uncle&#x2014;I often wonder what that must have been like, to have all your hopes and dreams right there, right at your fingertips, wearing that green uniform you always dreamed would be yours and then, <i>poof,</i> it was all gone in a crash.</p><p>Then again, as I looked at the casket, I thought that maybe I already knew.</p><p>Like I said before, your world can change in an instant.</p><p>Uncle Myron and I stopped in front of the coffin and lowered our heads. Myron sneaked a glance at me. He, of course, didn&#x2019;t believe that my father was still alive. He had agreed to do this because I asked&#x2014;begged, really&#x2014;and he was trying to &#x201c;bond&#x201d; with me by humoring my request.</p><p>The pine casket looked rotted, fragile, as though it might collapse if we just looked at it too hard. The answer was right there, feet in front of me. Either my dad was in that box or he wasn&#x2019;t. Simple when you put it that way.</p><p>I moved a little closer to the casket, hoping to feel something. My father was supposed to be in that box. Shouldn&#x2019;t I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. feel something if that were the case? Shouldn&#x2019;t there be a cold hand on my neck or a shiver down my spine?</p><p>I felt neither.</p><p>So maybe Dad wasn&#x2019;t in there.</p><p>I reached out and rested my hand on the lid of the casket.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;</p><p>It was Bow Tie. He had introduced himself to us as an environmental health inspector, but I had no idea what that meant.</p><p>&#x201c;I was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Bow Tie moved between my father&#x2019;s casket and me. &#x201c;I explained to you the protocol, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes, I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For reasons of both public safety and respect, no casket can be opened on these premises.&#x201d; He talked as if he were reading an SAT reading comprehension section out loud. &#x201c;This county transport vehicle will bring your father&#x2019;s casket to the medical examiner&#x2019;s office, where it will be opened by a trained professional. That is my job here&#x2014;to make sure that we have opened the correct grave, to make sure the casket matches the public records on the person being exhumed, to make sure that all proper health measures have been taken, and finally to make sure that the transport goes smoothly and respectfully. So if you don&#x2019;t mind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked at Myron. He nodded. I slowly lifted my hand off the soggy, dirty pine. I took a step back.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Bow Tie said.</p><p>The crane operator was whispering now with a groundskeeper. The groundskeeper&#x2019;s face turned white. I didn&#x2019;t like that. I didn&#x2019;t like it at all.</p><p>&#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d; I asked Bow Tie.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, what&#x2019;s with all the whispering?&#x201d;</p><p>Bow Tie started studying his clipboard as though it held some special answer.</p><p>Uncle Myron said, &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have nothing else to report at this time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;</p><p>The groundskeeper, his face still white, started securing the casket with nylon belts.</p><p>&#x201c;The casket will be at the medical examiner&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;That is all I can tell you at this time.&#x201d;</p><p>Bow Tie moved to the cab of the pickup truck and slid into the passenger seat. The driver started up the engine. I hurried toward his window.</p><p>&#x201c;When?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;When what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When will the medical examiner open the casket?&#x201d;</p><p>He checked his clipboard again, but it seemed as if it were just for show, as if he already knew the answer.</p><p>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>We were at the medical examiner&#x2019;s office, waiting for the casket to be opened, when my cell phone rang.</p><p>I was all set to ignore the call. The answer to the key question of my life&#x2014;was my father dead or alive?&#x2014;was mere moments away.</p><p>A phone call could wait, right?</p><p>Then again, I was just hanging around. Maybe a phone call would be a welcome distraction. I quickly checked the caller ID and saw it was my best friend Ema. Ema&#x2019;s real name is Emma, but she dresses all in black and has a bunch of tattoos, so some of the kids, way back when, considered her &#x201c;emo&#x201d; and then someone combined &#x201c;Emma&#x201d; with &#x201c;emo&#x201d; and cleverly (I&#x2019;m being sarcastic when I say &#x201c;cleverly&#x201d;) dubbed her Ema.</p><p>Still, the name stuck.</p><p>My first thought: Oh no, something bad happened to Spoon!</p><p>Uncle Myron leaned over my shoulder and pointed out the caller ID. &#x201c;Is that Angelica Wyatt&#x2019;s daughter?&#x201d;</p><p>I frowned. Like this was his business. &#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You two have become pretty tight.&#x201d;</p><p>I frowned some more. Like this was his business. &#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to do here. I could step away from my hovering uncle and answer it. Uncle Myron could be pretty thick, but even he&#x2019;d get the message. I held up the phone and said to him, &#x201c;Uh, do you mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? Oh, right. Sure. Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>I hit the answer button and said, &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>I mentioned that Ema was my best friend. We have only known each other a few weeks, but they&#x2019;ve been dangerous and crazy weeks, life-affirming and life-threatening weeks. People could be friends a lifetime and not come close to the bond that had formed between us.</p><p>&#x201c;Any word yet on the, uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; Ema didn&#x2019;t know how to finish that sentence. Neither did I.</p><p>&#x201c;It could come at any time,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at the medical examiner&#x2019;s office right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sorry. I shouldn&#x2019;t have disturbed you.&#x201d;</p><p>There was something in her tone that I didn&#x2019;t like. I felt my heart leap into my throat.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Is this about Spoon?&#x201d;</p><p>Spoon was my second-best friend, I guess. Last time I saw him, he was lying in a hospital bed. He had been shot, saving our lives, and it was now possible that he&#x2019;d never walk again. I blocked that horrible thought nonstop. I also dwelled on it nonstop.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard anything new?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. His parents aren&#x2019;t letting me visit either.&#x201d;</p><p>Spoon&#x2019;s mom and dad had forbidden me from entering his room. They blamed me for what happened. Then again, so did I.</p><p>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, I shouldn&#x2019;t have called. It isn&#x2019;t a big deal. Really.&#x201d;</p><p>Which only made me sure that whatever it was, it was a big deal. Really.</p><p>I was about to argue and insist she tell me why she had called, but Bow Tie came back into the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Gotta go,&#x201d; I said to her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you when I can.&#x201d;</p><p>I hung up. Myron and I stepped toward Bow Tie. He had his head down, taking notes.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Myron said.</p><p>&#x201c;We should have the results in a few moments.&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that I had been holding my breath. I let it out now. Then I asked, &#x201c;What was all that whispering about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the cemetery. With the guys digging and the one operating the bulldozer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That.&#x201d;</p><p>I waited.</p><p>Bow Tie cleared his throat. &#x201c;The groundskeepers&#x201d;&#x2014;so, okay, that&#x2019;s what they were called&#x2014;&#x201c;noted that the casket felt a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He looked up as though searching for the next word.</p><p>After three seconds that felt like an hour passed, I said, &#x201c;Felt a little what?&#x201d;</p><p>And then he said it: &#x201c;Light.&#x201d;</p><p>Myron said, &#x201c;As in weight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes.

I&#x2019;m Dr. Botnick.&#x201d;</p><p>I expected the medical examiner to look ghoulish or creepy or something. Think about it. Medical examiners deal with dead people all day. They slice them open and try to figure out what killed them.</p><p>But Dr. Botnick was a tiny woman with an inappropriately happy smile and the kind of red hair that borders on orange. Her office had been completely stripped of any sort of personality. There was nothing personal in the entire room&#x2014;no family photographs, for example, but then again, in a room filled with so much death, did people want to stare at images of her loved ones? Her desk was bare except for a brown leather desk pad with matching letter tray (empty), memo holder, pencil cup (two pens and one pencil), and a letter opener. The walls had diplomas, and nothing else.</p><p>She kept smiling at us. I looked at Myron. He looked lost.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not very good with people. Then again, none of my patients complain.&#x201d; She started laughing. I didn&#x2019;t join in. Neither did Uncle Myron. She cleared her throat and said, &#x201c;Get it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Because my patients, well, they&#x2019;re dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; I said again.</p><p>&#x201c;Inappropriate, right? My bad. Truth? I&#x2019;m a little nervous. This is an unusual situation.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt my pulse pick up speed.</p><p>Dr. Botnick looked over at Myron. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Myron Bolitar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;d be Brad Bolitar&#x2019;s brother?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes found mine. &#x201c;And you must be his son?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She wrote something down on a sheet of paper. &#x201c;Could you tell me the cause of death?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Car accident,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; She jotted another note. &#x201c;Usually when people request we exhume a body, it is because they wish to move burial grounds. That isn&#x2019;t the case here, is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Myron and I both said no.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is Kitty Hammer Bolitar?&#x201d; Dr. Botnick asked.</p><p>Kitty Hammer Bolitar was my mother.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not here,&#x201d; Myron said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes, I can see that.

At first, only small details, but the changes get bigger and bigger. It's up to Conrad, a twelve-year-old with terrible karma who's just joined the mansion's staff, to find out who is behind it.</p><p>But he's not the only one snooping around. His fellow servant-in-training, Christopher Chant, is charming, confident, and from another world, with a mission of his own -- rescuing his friend, lost in an alternate Stallery Mansion. Can they save the day before Conrad's awful fate catches up with them?</p></p><p>Devotees of <i>The Chrestomanci Quartet</i> and <i>Mixed Magics</i> will pounce on this sixth title in the series by Diana Wynne Jones, whose reputation as a fantasy writer is also enhanced by <i>Archer&#x2019;s Goon</i> and <i>Howl&#x2019;s Moving Castle</i> (soon to be an animated film). In this Chrestomanci tale, the nine-lived enchanter Christopher, who fans will remember from other books, appears as a dapper and self-possessed 15-year-old, and the narrator is young Conrad Tesdinic, who at the age of twelve has just finished school in the mountain village of Stallchester in the English Alps. He yearns to go on to Stall High, but his tight-fisted Uncle Alfred has other plans. With the help of magical spells and a story of bad karma, he intimidates Conrad into going off to serve on the staff at Stallery Mansion, burdened with a secret about an unknown person he must kill. Conrad makes the best of his new life, especially after he meets his elegant new roommate Christopher, who is, he explains, the heir in a different time level to the job of Chrestomanci, an enchanter appointed by the government to control the use of magic. Conrad joins him in his desperate search for his friend Millie, who has vanished from a parallel time track. Amusing scenes of life below stairs in the highly stratified servants&#x2019; quarters alternate with the boys&#x2019; strange adventures as they seek through other realities within the castle on their day off, glimpsing Millie but never able to reach her. With Wynne Jones&#x2019; characteristic skill at plotting, the finale is a whirlwind of revealed alter-identities and just desserts for villains, ending with as many satisfying romantic pairings as a Shakespeare comedy. (Ages 10-13) <i>--Patty Campbell</i><p>In a career spanning four decades, award-winning author Diana Wynne Jones (1934&#x2012;2011) wrote more than forty books of fantasy for young readers.

In its third edition in Greek, the book has been recently translated into English. The prayers emphasize the priority of speaking to God in all of the circumstances and conditions of our lives. They reflect the challenges and triumphs, struggles and joy, weaknesses and strengths of our human condition in a manner that affirms the priority of faith and the presence and love of God. The book has five sections or cycles: (1) asking God to teach us how to pray; (2) talking to God about ourselves and our problems; (3) singing the praises of His glory and majesty; (4) entreating Him on behalf of our brothers and sisters; and (5) addressing the need for a true approach to the Gospel. Speaking to God is a great resource for daily prayer. You will find strength and inspiration through prayers that help you converse with God and find in Him the love, wisdom, and peace you need in all of life&#39;s experiences. Quotes &#34;We should speak to God. We should present our problems to Jesus. We should set in front of Him our hard times and our disappointments. We should place our plans, our worries, and desires in His hands. This is the meaning and message that this book wishes to bring to the world.&#34; (From the Introduction) &#34;My God, conversation with You is something simple. But at the same time it is also difficult. A dialogue with You, I feel, constitutes the highest art, the most profound science, and the most authentic life.&#34; (Page 10) &#34;My God, make me a prayerful person. Connect me through prayer with my eternal well.&#34; (Page 15) &#34;On my knees...I lift up my hands to You, I raise my heart to sing to You about Your great glory and about Your immeasurable power.&#34; (Page 83)</p><p></p><h2>Roget&#39;s Children&#39;s Thesaurus</h2><p>Contains more than one thousand entries arranged alphabetically, with illustrative sentences to help in choosing the exact word from several synonyms.</p><p></p><h2>The Suspicions Of Mr Whicher</h2><p>In June of 1860 three-year-old Saville Kent was found at the bottom of an outdoor privy with his throat slit. The crime horrified all England and led to a national obsession with detection, ironically destroying, in the process, the career of perhaps the greatest detective in the land.<p>At the time, the detective was a relatively new invention; there were only eight detectives in all of England and rarely were they called out of London, but this crime was so shocking that Scotland Yard sent its best man to investigate, Inspector Jonathan Whicher. </p>Whicher quickly believed the unbelievable&#x2014;that someone within the family was responsible for the murder of young Saville Kent. Without sufficient evidence or a confession, though, his case was circumstantial and he returned to London a broken man. Though he would be vindicated five years later, the real legacy of Jonathan Whicher lives on in fiction: the tough, quirky, knowing, and all-seeing detective that we know and love today: from the cryptic Sergeant Cuff in Wilkie Collins&#x2019;s <i>The Moonstone </i>to Dashiell Hammett&#x2019;s Sam Spade. <p><i>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher </i>is a provocative work of nonfiction that reads like a Victorian thriller, and in it author Kate Summerscale has fashioned a brilliant, multilayered narrative that is as cleverly constructed as it is beautifully written. </p></p><p>KATE SUMMERSCALE is the former literary editor for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and author of <i>The Queen of Whale Cay</i>, which won the Somerset Maugham Award and was shortlisted for the Whitbread biography award. Summerscale lives in London.<br><br>SIMON VANCE is a prolific and popular audiobook narrator and actor with several hundred audiobooks to his credit. An Audie� Award-winner, Vance was recently named "The Voice of Choice" by <i>Booklist</i> magazine.<b><i>From </i>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher: <p></p></b><i>The Victorians made a romance of detection. In a newly uncertain world, a detective seemed to offer science, conviction, stories that could organise chaos. He turned brutal crimes&#x2014;the vestiges of the beast in man&#x2014;into intellectual puzzles. He was a secular substitute for a prophet or a priest. Yet the Victorians also made a fetish of privacy, and many felt that the investigation at Road Hill amounted to a violation of the middle-class home. Mr Whicher exposed the corruptions within the household: sexual transgression, emotional cruelty, scheming servants, wayward children, insanity, jealousy, loneliness and loathing. The scene he uncovered aroused fear (and excitement) at the thought of what might be hiding behind the closed doors of other respectable houses. His conclusions helped to create an era of voyeurism and suspicion, in which the detective was a shadowy figure, a demon as well as a demigod.</i></p><h2>Hannibal&#39;s Oath: The Life and Wars of Rome&#39;s Greatest Enemy</h2><p><b>According to the ancient sources, Hannibal was nine years old when his father led him to the temple at Carthage and dipped the young boy's hands in the blood of the sacrificial victim. Before those gods, Hannibal swore an oath of eternal hatred toward Rome.</b><br><br>Few images in history have managed to capture and hold the popular imagination quite like that of Hannibal, the fearless North African, perched on a monstrous elephant, leading his mercenaries over the Alps, and then, against all odds, descending the ice-covered peaks to challenge Rome in her own backyard for mastery of the ancient world. It was a bold move, and it established Hannibal as one of history's greatest commanders. But this same brilliant tactician is also one of history's most tragic figures; fate condemned him to win his battles but not his war against Rome.<br><br>An internationally recognized expert on Hannibal for nearly thirty years, historian John Prevas has visited every Hannibal-related site and mountain pass, from Tunisia to Italy, Spain to Turkey, seeking evidence to dispel the myths surrounding Hannibal's character and his wars.<br><br><i>Hannibal's Oath</i> is an easily readable yet comprehensive biography of this iconic military leader--an epic account of a monumental and tragic life.<br></p><p><b>John Prevas</b> is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author whose first book, <i>Hannibal Crosses the Alps</i>, ignited the debate among academics over which pass Hannibal used--a debate which continues today.

Prevas has appeared on the History Channel, CNN, CNN International, NPR, C-Span's Book TV, and Fox Television.<br>"Here, at last, is a biography worthy of one of history's most fascinating figures, whose crossing of the Alps with elephants to take on the mighty Roman Empire has captured imaginations for more than two thousand years.

Close-lipped and ever-watchful, he has used his highly attuned senses to collect information about his brothers, his temple, and even Grandmaster. Now, with the temple and Grandmaster gone, Seh sheds his orange robe like an old skin, joins a bandit gang, and meets a mysterious woman whose name means Cobra&#x2014;all the while trying to stay one step ahead of vengeful Ying!<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Jeff Stone lives in the Midwest with his wife, their two children, and a python named Yokwan. He holds a black belt in Shaolin-Do kung fu. Like the Five Ancestors, he was adopted as an infant. He began searching for his birth parents when he was 18 and found them 15 years later. He is hard at work on the Five Ancestors #5.Prologue<br><br>Eight-year-old Seh slid his lanky body along the enormous rafter high above the Cangzhen banquet table, doing his best to disturb as little dust as possible. Even in a room as dark as this, Grandmaster would notice a single particle drifting toward the floor. Grandmaster was that good.<br><br>But Seh was better. As long as he didn&#x2019;t lose focus.<br><br>Once in position, Seh stretched to his full length and flattened himself against the top of the wooden beam. He began to slow his breathing. His heart rate slowed to that of a hibernating reptile beneath a sheet of ice. She began to wait.<br><br>An hour later, Grandmaster entered the room. Although Grandmaster didn&#x2019;t say a word, Seh knew exactly who it was.He sensed powerful chi&#x2013;life energy&#x2013; radiating from Grandmaster&#x2019;s body like heat from the sun.<br><br>Seh slowed his breathing further. He needed to keep his heart rate as slow as possible so that the chi coursing through his own nervous system would not alert Grandmaster to his presence. As long as he remained calm, Grandmaster would not detect him. Dragon-style kung fu masters like Grandmaster and Seh&#x2019;s brother Long possessed tremendous amounts of chi, but they weren&#x2019;t particularly good at detecting it in others. Snake stylists like Seh, however, were masters at detecting the most minute amounts in any living creature.<br><br>As Grandmaster stepped farther into the hall, She heard a second man stop in the doorway. Seh took a long, slow breath.<br><br>Seh focused on the visitor and noticed something strange. The man seemed to possess no chi at all, which was impossible. All living things possessed chi. This<br>could mean only one thing&#x2013;Grandmaster&#x2019;s visitor was masking his, something only snake-style kung fu masters knew how to do. And the only snake-style master to ever visit Grandmaster in the middle of the night was&#x2013;One corner of Seh&#x2019;s mouth slid down his long face in a lopsided frown. He peeked over the rafter toward the moonlit doorway and his eyes confirmed what the pit of his stomach already knew. Grandmaster&#x2019;s visitor was a man named Mong, a local bandit leader. Mong meant &#x201c;python&#x201d; in Cantonese. Seh had had more than one humiliating encounter with the gigantic snake-style kung fu master over the years, and he had no interest in seeing the man again.<br><br>Grandmaster turned to Mong and whispered, &#x201c;Do you sense that we are alone?&#x201d;<br><br>Seh remained perfectly still and watched Mong scan the room. Seh was enshrouded in darkness and positioned at a severe angle from the doorway. He was certain he was invisible. Yet when Mong&#x2019;s eyes hesitated as they passed over the rafter, Seh knew he had been discovered. Mong had sensed his chi. Seh was about to begin his retreat when Mong turned toward Grandmaster.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, we are alone,&#x201d; Mong said. &#x201c;Nothing here but the occasional small pest.&#x201d; Mong entered the hall and closed the doors behind him.<br><br>Seh clenched his teeth. Pest? he thought. Seh wondered whether Mong was trying to make him angry so that his heart rate would rise and he&#x2019;d reveal himself. There was nothing Seh hated more than getting caught when he was sneaking around.<br><br>Seh did his best to stay calm. He needed to stay focused.He suspected that Grandmaster and Mong were both dealers of secrets. They would trade them like<br>other people traded gold for silk or silver for swords. She wanted those secrets. Especially if they involved him and his brothers&#x2013;and Seh had a hunch they would.<br><br>&#x201c;What news do you bring?&#x201d; Grandmaster asked Mong. &#x201c;And what might you require in return for sharing it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no new information,&#x201d; Mong replied. &#x201c;This visit is purely personal.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandmaster nodded. &#x201c;The boys are progressing well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I suspect they&#x2019;ll all be masters in record time. Though I worry about the maturity level of some of them. Fu and Malao in particular come to mind.&#x201d;<br><br>Mong chuckled. &#x201c;I imagine Fu and Malao could be a handful, especially if they&#x2019;re together. How is Long doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; Grandmaster replied. &#x201c;He is wise beyond his years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Mong said. &#x201c;And what about the girl?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hok is progressing well, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Seh nearly tumbled off the rafter. Hok? A girl? He took a long, slow breath. Mong was trying to break his concentration, and that last bit of information had nearly done it. But Seh was certain he could remain calm, no matter what Mong said next.<br><br>He was wrong.<br><br>&#x201c;And what about my son?&#x201d; Mong asked.<br><br>No . . . , Seh thought. It can&#x2019;t be. . . . He swallowed hard as his heart began to beat in his throat. He couldn&#x2019;t control it. He glared down at Mong, wondering if it was a trick.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Grandmaster glanced up at the beam. &#x201c;Seh is also progressing well. Perhaps too well. I worry about him most of all.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Sons of the Reich: The History of II SS Panzer Corps</h2><p>This authoritative history follows the actions of the designated Divisions of II SS Panzer Corps in the Ukraine, Normandy, at Arnhem and Nijmegen, in the Battle of the Bulge, on the Eastern Front and to the final battles in defense of the Reich.<br><br>Michael Reynolds has analyzed each of the campaigns of II SS Panzer Corps. As a former professional soldier, he is experienced in battle and modern armored tactics. Able to narrate each action in a unique manner, his refreshing candor and conclusions, reached without bias or prejudice, will surprise many. <br><br>Since retiring from a distinguished military career during which he commanded NATO&#x2019;s International Mobile Force (Land) and headed its Military Plans and Policy Division, Major General Michael Reynolds has become a respected historian and writer. His previous books, The Devil&#x2019;s Adjutant, Steel Inferno and Men of Steel have brought him international recognition and he is now accepted as a leading specialist on the Waffen-SS and its actions in World War II.</p><p>Major General Michael Reynolds CB joined the British Army in 1948, and was commissioned into the Queens Royal Regiment in 1950. In the course of a long and distinguished career, he served in Korea, where he was severely wounded, Northern Ireland and West Germany. On promotion to Major General he assumed command of NATO&#39;s Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Land). In retirement, he became guest speaker on British Army and NATO battlefield tours in the Ardennes, publishing a number of detailed histories on World War 2 operations in Europe. He died in 2015.There is no doubt that former British army general Michael Reynolds is one of the foremost experts on the premier armoured divisions of the Waffen SS. This volume covers II SS Panzer corps whose mainstay divisions were the 9th and 10th SS Panzer divisions, with other units such as 2nd SS being brought under the corps command at various times in the story.. Whilst a little dry at times it is nevertheless well written and provides a detailed and comprehensive history of the Corps. This book will be of particular interest to those seeking a German perspectives on the Normandy battles, Arnhem and the Ardennes. It also covers participation in the battles in Hungary in 1945. These units saw extensive combat in the last twelve months of the war and readers will be astounded at how the remnants of the shattered divisions rebuilt themselves time and again. The account chronologically deals with the operations and day to actions of the units and Reynolds narrative is interrupted by well chosen first hand accounts. The inclusion of 35 maps, referenced in the headings of the various chapters, is most helpful - particularly as they are very clear. One will also find other useful supporting information in the appendix (unit composition). For those interested in the subjects of this book I wholeheartedly recommend this work along with Reynolds two volumes. covering the I SS Panzer Corps. --By Philip Spiers</p><h2>Performance Riding Techniques - Fully revised and updated: The MotoGP manual of track riding skills</h2><p>An official MotoGP book,&nbsp;this practical guide to motorcycle racing technique, aimed at racing and track day enthusiasts at all levels, has been fully revised to include new information as well as many fresh photographs and up-to-date quotes from MotoGP stars.

Imaginary numbers entered into mathematics in sixteenth-century Italy and were used with immediate success, but nevertheless presented an intriguing challenge to the imagination. It took more than two hundred years for mathematicians to discover a satisfactory way of "imagining" these numbers. <br><br>With discussions about how we comprehend ideas both in poetry and in mathematics, Mazur reviews some of the writings of the earliest explorers of these elusive figures, such as Rafael Bombelli, an engineer who spent most of his life draining the swamps of Tuscany and who in his spare moments composed his great treatise "L'Algebra". Mazur encourages his readers to share the early bafflement of these Renaissance thinkers. Then he shows us, step by step, how to begin imagining, ourselves, imaginary numbers.<br></p><p><b>Barry Mazur</b> does his mathematics at Harvard University and lives in Cambridge, Massachussetts, with the writer Grace Dane Mazur.<br>PREFACE <p>1, 2, 3, . . . The "counting numbers" are part of us. We know them forward and backward. Babies as young as five months old, psychologists claim, are sensitive to the difference between 1 + 1 and 2 - 1. We sing numbers, counting up the days of Christmas and counting down to the poignant monotheism of "One is one and all alone and evermore shall be so."&nbsp; </p><p>Our ancestors have added to this repertoire and reckoned with zero and the negative numbers, which were sometimes referred to as fictions <i>(fictae)</i> before they gained familiarity.&nbsp; </p><p>All these together constitute what we call the <i>whole numbers</i>,&nbsp;. . . , -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, . . .&nbsp; </p><p>More formally, they are called <i>integers</i>, from the Latin adjective meaning "whole, untouched, unharmed."&nbsp; </p><p>"Whole," "untouched"; their very name hints that integers <i>can be</i> touched, or fractionated. Indeed they can be, and when they are, we get the larger array of numbers that are <i>fractions</i>, ratios of whole numbers.&nbsp; </p><p>Fractions, as their notation vividly displays, also stand for proportions (think of 1/2 = 2/4 as "one is to two as two is to four and for actions (think of 1/2 as "halving," ready to cut in half anything that follows it). To bring fractions into line, we express them as decimals (1/2 = 0.5000000 . . . ). The modem world gives us much experience with decimals to a high degree of accuracy -- to "many decimal places"; mathematics, as always, goes all the way, happy to deal with numbers with complete accuracy -- to <i>infinitely</i> many decimal places. Numbers represented by infinitely many decimal places, whether they are fractions or not, are called real numbers.&nbsp; </p><p>But the telltale adjective <i>real</i> suggests two things: that these numbers are somehow real to us and that, in contrast, there are <i>unreal</i> numbers in the offing. These are the <i>imaginary numbers</i>.&nbsp; </p><p>The <i>imaginary</i> numbers are well named, for there is some imaginative work to do to make them as much a part of us as the real numbers we use all the time to measure for bookshelves.&nbsp; </p><p>This book began as a letter to my friend Michel Chaouli. The two of us had been musing about whether or not one could "feel" the workings of the imagination in its various labors. Michel had also mentioned that he wanted to "imagine imaginary numbers." That very (rainy) evening, I tried to work up an explanation of the idea of these numbers, still in the mood of our conversation.&nbsp; </p><p>The text of my letter was the welcome excuse for continued conversation with a number of friends, many of whom were humanists interested in understanding what it means to imagine the square root of negative numbers. The successive revisions and expansions of my letter were shaped by their questions, comments, critiques, and insights. This book, then, is written for people who have no training in mathematics and who may not have actively thought about mathematics since high school, or even during it, but who may wish to experience an act of mathematical imagining and to consider how such an experience compares with the imaginative work involved in reading and understanding a phrase in a poem. Of course, poetry and mathematics are far apart. All the more glorious, then, for people at home in the imaginative life of poetry to use their insight and sensibility to witness the imagination at work in mathematics.&nbsp; </p><p>Although no particular mathematical knowledge is necessary, pencil and paper are good to have at hand, to make a few calculations (multiplying small numbers, mostly). The operation of multiplication itself is something we will be looking at. There are three standard ways of denoting the act of multiplication: by a <i>cross</i> �, by a <i>centered dot</i> �, or, when there is no ambiguity, by <i>simple juxtaposition</i> of the objects to be multiplied. Which notation we use reflects where we wish to direct our attention: the equation&nbsp; </p><p>2 x 3 = 6&nbsp; </p><p>emphasizes the <i>act</i> of multiplying 2 times 3, whereas&nbsp; </p><p>2 � 3 = 6&nbsp; </p><p>focuses on the <i>result</i>, 6, of that operation. Nevertheless, despite this difference in nuance, both equations, 2 x 3 = 6 and 2 � 3 = 6, are saying the same thing. When we deal with an unknown quantity <i>X</i>, here are three equivalent ways of denoting 5 times that unknown quantity:&nbsp; </p><p>5 � <i>X</i> = 5�<i>X</i>= 5<i>X</i>.&nbsp; </p><p>Again, we write 5 � <i>X</i> if we want to emphasize the act of multiplying and 5�<i>X</i> or 5<i>X</i> if we want to emphasize the result; and that last variant notation, juxtaposition, is used for visual conciseness.&nbsp; </p><p>Copyright � 2003 Barry Mazur</p></p><h2>Ubik (Gollancz S.F.)</h2><p>Philip K. Dick&#39;s searing metaphysical comedy of death and salvation is a tour de force of panoramic menace and unfettered slapstick, in which the departed give business advice, shop for their next incarnation, and run the continual risk of dying yet again.</p><p>Nobody but Philip K. Dick could so successfully combine SF comedy with the unease of reality gone wrong, shifting underfoot like quicksand. Besides grisly ideas like funeral parlors where you swap gossip for the advice of the frozen dead, <i>Ubik</i> (1969) offers such deadpan farce as a moneyless character's attack on the robot apartment door that demands a five-cent toll:<p> </p><blockquote>"I'll sue you," the door said as the first screw fell out.<p> Joe Chip said, "I've never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it."</p></blockquote><p> Chip works for Glen Runciter's anti-psi security agency, which hires out its talents to block telepathic snooping and paranormal dirty tricks. When its special team tackles a big job on the Moon, something goes terribly wrong. Runciter is killed, it seems--but messages from him now appear on toilet walls, traffic tickets, or product labels. Meanwhile, fragments of reality are timeslipping into past versions: Joe Chip's beloved stereo system reverts to a hand-cranked 78 player with bamboo needles. Why does Runciter's face appear on U.S. coins? Why the repeated ads for a hard-to-find universal panacea called Ubik ("safe when taken as directed")?</p><p> The true, chilling state of affairs slowly becomes clear, though the villain isn't who Joe Chip thinks. And this is Dick country, where final truths are never quite final and--with the help of Ubik--the reality/illusion balance can still be tilted the other way. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p> From the stuff of space opera, Dick spins a deeply unsettling existential horror story, a nightmare you ll never be sure you ve woken up from. Lev Grossman, <i>Time</i> <br>Glen Runciter runs a lucrative business deploying his teams of anti-psychics to corporate clients who want privacy and security from psychic spies. But when he and his top team are ambushed by a rival, he is gravely injured and placed in half-life, a dreamlike state of suspended animation. Soon, though, the surviving members of the team begin experiencing some strange phenomena, such as Runciter s face appearing on coins and the world seeming to move backward in time. As consumables deteriorate and technology gets ever more primitive, the group needs to find out what is causing the shifts and what a mysterious product called Ubik has to do with it all. <br> More brilliant than similar experiments conducted by Pynchon or DeLillo. Roberto Bolano <br>PHILIP K. DICK (1928 1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels and is considered one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century. His work is included in the Library of America and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>. <br>"</p></p><h2>Bless Me, Father, For I Have Kids</h2><p><b>The uninterrupted life is not worth living</b><p> Got questions about Catholic family life?

Susie herself is too busy to give advice: busy giving home haircuts and finding missing socks; busy teaching her teen girls to drive, cook, and diagram sentences; busy praying for divine protection while she races off to church (late) in her full-size van. But every so often, Susie finds a few moments to share the wit and wisdom she s gleaned from:</p><p> <b>Teaching her kids about the Facts of Life</b> Somewhere there must be a book which can aid me in my duty.

It gets worse if your dad thinks it would be lovely not only to wear the skirt but a veil as well. </p><p> <b>Handing on Catholic customs</b> When I was small, my mother taught me to say a Hail Mary whenever I heard an ambulance. It s really a beautiful habit and habit is the word -- I don t know how many people I ve prayed for whose car alarm was going off. </p><p> <b>Getting older</b> Some people tell me I could be my teens older sister. These people are usually 103 years old and wear their glasses hanging from a chain. But I ll take it. </p><p> <b>Strangers who question the size of her family</b> What s funny is, the people who call you nuts really expect you to act sane, and not like this: Nuts? Children, would one of you be a good girl and get the gun out of Mommy s diaper bag? </p><p> <b>Enduring her children's music lessons</b> Piano recitals are a time-honored way of gaining a plenary indulgence, provided we hold no attachment to murdering the piano teacher. </p><p> <b>Joing a homeschool co-op</b> None of us wanted to quit homeschooling; we just wanted somebody else to do it for us. </p><p> As she did in her beloved first book, <i>Please Don t Drink the Holy Water,</i> in these pages Susie Lloyd will charm and edify you with her offbeat -- but always pitch-perfect -- take on the joys and challenges of raising a Catholic family in today s world.</p></p><p><b>Susie Lloyd</b> writes for <i>Faith &amp; Family, The Latin Mass</i> and other Catholic magazines.

One of Hawaiian mythology&#39;s greatest epics is freshly interpreted by Dietrich Varez, one of Hawai&#39;i&#39;s most celebrated artists. The story of Pele, goddess of Hawai&#39;i&#39;s volcanoes, and her youngest sister, Hi&#39;iakaikapoliopele is retold and lavishly illustrated with the artist s iconic block prints. The sensitive visual interpretation and simplified text honor the rich mythology passed through Hawaiian oral tradition.This picture-book style presentation offers a fresh visual tribute to these enduring mythical figures with the turning of each page. After a quarrel with her sister, the sea goddess Namakaokaha&#39;i, Pele fled her homeland of Kahiki accompanied by members of her family. She settled into the fiery lava pit of Kilauea, in the upland region of Hawai&#39;i island. Deep in a dream, Pele, in her spirit form, followed the sounds of hula pahu drums. She arrived at Kaua&#39;i and was immediately captivated by the handsome young chief, Lohi&#39;au. When she awoke, Pele asked each of her sisters to go fetch her new lover. Hi&#39;iaka agreed to undertake the perilous journey. With her companions, Hi&#39;iaka encountered many adventures on her travels throughout the Hawaiian islands battling reptilian mo&#39;o and other evil creatures, helping people in need, making new friends and visiting old ones. Pele and Hi&#39;iaka is ultimately a testament to the enduring power of love.</p><p>Dietrich Varez was born in Berlin, Germany in 1939. He moved to Hawai&#39;i at the age of eight, when his mother married an American soldier, who brought the family home to Hawai&#39;i. Growing up island-style on O&#39;ahu, he attended UH Manoa, earning a Masters degree in English. There he met his wife, Linda, a fellow artist, before moving the family to Hawai&#39;i Island in 1968. Varez finds inspiration in the realm of the goddess, Pele, who appears prominently in his body of work.</p><h2>The Late, Great Planet Earth</h2><p>A guide to finding the future in the text of the Bible argues that many of the predictions made in the Old and New Testaments--the rebirth of Israel, unrest in the Middle East, the revival of interest in Satanism--have come true.

Carlson is the author or coauthor of many books, including Our Values: Stories and Wisdom and The Teacher Who Couldn&#x2019;t ReadThe impact of The Late Great Planet Earth cannot be overstated. The New York Times called it the &#39;no. 1 non-fiction bestseller of the decade.&#39; For Christians and non-Christians of the 1970s, Hal Lindsey&#39;s blockbuster served as a wake-up call on events soon to come and events already unfolding -- all leading up to the greatest event of all: the return of Jesus Christ. The years since have confirmed Lindsey&#39;s insights into what biblical prophecy says about the times we live in. Whether you&#39;re a church-going believer or someone who wouldn&#39;t darken the door of a Christian institution, the Bible has much to tell you about the imminent future of this planet. In the midst of an out-of-control generation, it reveals a grand design that&#39;s unfolding exactly according to plan. The rebirth of Israel. The threat of war in the Middle East. An increase in natural catastrophes. The revival of Satanism and witchcraft. These and other signs, foreseen by prophets from Moses to Jesus, portend the coming of an antichrist . . . of a war which will bring humanity to the brink of destruction . . . and of incredible deliverance for a desperate, dying planet.</p><h2>Verdi&#39;s Shakespeare: Men of the Theater</h2><p><b> A dazzling study of the operas Verdi adapted from Shakespeare- and a spellbinding account of their creation. </b><p>In <i>Verdi's Shakespeare,</i> Pulitzer Prize winner and lifelong opera devotee Garry Wills explores the writing and staging of Verdi's three triumphant Shakespearian operas: <i>Macbeth, Othello,</i> and <i>Falstaff</i>. An Italian composer who couldn't read a word of English but adored Shakespeare, Verdi devoted himself to operatic productions that authentically incorporated the playwright's texts. Wills delves into the fast-paced worlds of these men of the theater, focusing on the intense working relationships both Shakespeare and Verdi had with the performers and producers of their works. We see Verdi study the Shakespearean dramaturgy as he obsessively corresponds with his chosen librettists, handpicks the singers he feels are best- suited to the roles, and coaches them intensely.</p><p>With fascinating portraits of these artistic giants and their entourages, sharp insights into music and theater, and telling historical details, <i>Verdi's Shakespeare</i> re-creates the conditions that allowed Verdi to complete his masterworks and illuminates the very nature of artistic creation.</p></p><p>Garry Wills is one of the most respected writers on religion today.

This classic book is full of useful tips on how to live a more conscious life and to be an engaged and aware member of the universal community. </p> <p>"While we have humility and pride enough to act on the knowledge that we exist in an infinite harmony, that we are neither greater nor lesser than any others, we can enjoy exquisite spiritual wealth and pleasures. When you love yourself, you are in truth expanding in love into many other things. And the more loving you are, the more loving the beings within and around you. On all levels we are mutually dependent vibrations. Play a happy tune and happy dancers will join your trip." - From The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment</p> <p>After serving in World War II, author Thaddeus Golas graduated from Columbia College in New York. He later moved to San Francisco, where he became involved in the activism and spiritual quests of the 1960s. He was an editor of Redbook magazine and a book representative for publisher Harper and Row.</p></p><p><p>"We are equal beings and the universe is our relations with each other. The universe is made of one kind of entity: each one is alive, each determines the course of his own existence.</p> <p>"That is really all you need to know to understand this book or to write your own. Everything that I say has it's roots in that first paragraph, and it's possible to resolve any question by going back to it and thinking it through for yourself."</p> <p>These words of Thaddeus Golas's, written back in 1971, still ring true, will always ring true. Now, The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment come to us in an attractive hardcover edition, including an author's introduction and author photographs. In the introduction, Golas reveals the events in his life leading up to the writing of the book and the response to the Guide during its many years in print. It is a book for equal beings from all backgrounds.</p> <p>"The concept that we live in a universe of equal beings can make sense of all religions, and can contain all metaphysical attitudes. It is ithe easiest raft to discard when we reach the other shore that is no shore. It can tell us how to live on this plane; it can show how our physical existence is the expression of spiritual laws. It gives us an absolutely confident understanding of what is true and what is real.</p> <p>"Equal and unique live beings are all that is fully true and real in the universe. We are the universe."</p><p>You don't have to work hard or suffer to be in paradise</p> <p>"I am a lazy man. Laziness keeps me from believing that enlightenment demands effort, discipline, strict diet, non-smoking, and other evidences of virture. There is a paradise in and around you right now, and to be there you don't even have to make a move. All potential experiences are within you already. You can open up to them at any time. There is an odd chance that this is what someone needs to read in order to feel better about himself. If you are a kind person and want to know what ot expect when elightenment strikes and why it comes to you, this is for you."</p> <p>"It's all right to have a good time. That's one of the most important messages from enlightenment." --From The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment</p></p><h2>The Final Martyrs</h2><p>All the salient qualities that distinguish the superb work of Japanese writer Shusaku Endo are on full display in this new collection of eleven stories written over the course of almost thirty years. The themes are akin to those in the author's novels (Silence and The Sea and Poison, for example): the martyrdom of Roman Catholics in Japan; coming to terms with old age - a compound of infirmity, fear, and pangs of nostalgia; the incongruity of Japanese travelers in Europe; spiritual doubt and sexual yearning; and, clearly, elements of autobiography, particularly of Endo's lonely boyhood unhappiness over the strife between his parents that ended in divorce.<br>There is no other contemporary Japanese writer who has achieved such a balanced blend of things Western with those inherently Japanese. As John Updike comments in The New Yorker, Endo's work is "sombre, delicate, startlingly emphatic." It is also uniquely moving in its compassionate exploration of the human condition.</p><p>Shusaku Endo (1923&#x2013;1996) is widely regarded as one of the most important Japanese authors of the late twentieth century. He won many major literary awards and was nominated for the Nobel Prize several times. His novel Silence was recently made into a major film directed by Martin Scorsese.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>Seven Deadly Sins</h2><p>Hard Back with moderate wear to dust cover due to shelving &amp; stocking.</p><p></p><h2>The Work of Art: Plein Air Painting and Artistic Identity in Nineteenth-Century France</h2><p>In <i>The Work of Art</i>, Anthea Callen analyzes the self-portraits, portraits of fellow artists, photographs, prints, and studio images of prominent nineteenth-century French Impressionist painters, exploring the emergence of modern artistic identity and its relation to the idea of creative work. Landscape painting in general, she argues, and the &#x201c;plein air&#x201d; oil sketch in particular were the key drivers of change in artistic practice in the nineteenth century&#x2015;leading to the Impressionist revolution.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Putting the work of artists from Courbet and C�zanne to Pissaro under a microscope, Callen examines modes of self-representation and painting methods, paying particular attention to the painters&#x2019; touch and mark-making. Using innovative methods of analysis, she provides new and intriguing ways of understanding material practice within its historical moment and the cultural meanings it generates. Richly illustrated with 180 color and black-and-white images, <i>The Work of Art</i> offers fresh insights into the development of avant-garde French painting and the concept of the modern artist.<br></p><p><b>Anthea Callen </b>is professor of art in the School of Art at the Australian National University, Canberra, and professor emerita of visual studies at the University of Nottingham, UK. Her many books include <i>Art, Sex and Eugenics: Corpus Delecti</i> and <i>The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity</i>.<br>&#x201c;Callen, probably more than anyone else working on nineteenth-century painting today, is able to combine an artist&#x2019;s experience of studio practice with an art historian&#x2019;s rigorous use of documentation. Her work is immensely valuable for its combination of sensitive visual observation and scrupulous attention to details of historical fact. . . . This book is a major accomplishment.&#x201d; (Richard Shiff, University of Texas at Austin)<br><br>&#x201c;Callen&#x2019;s book is a fascinating exploration of the material practices of French outdoor landscape painters in the nineteenth century. Focusing on hardware, including folding seats, paint boxes, backpacks, palette knives, brushes, and newly available tube paints, Callen argues that this often overlooked dimension of the work of the outdoor landscape painter is crucial for understanding how plein air painting took form. Her discussion includes the class associations of painter&#x2019;s smocks and trowels, as well as the gender restrictions of what was an almost exclusively masculine practice. The book is organized into four richly illustrated and carefully researched chapters. Readers first encounter the early techniques and procedures of practitioners of plein air landscape sketching, including Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, before moving to the coarse-grained and materialist concerns of Gustav Courbet, Camille Pissarro, and Paul C�zanne. The text concludes with a fascinating discussion of the neo-Impressionist landscapes of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac and their relationship to the traditional craft practices of needlework, embroidery, and weaving. Callen&#x2019;s presentation and analysis of the hardware available to outdoor landscape painters contributes an important new dimension to the broader understanding of nineteenth-century French&nbsp;painting. . . . Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It is a well-known story, but Callen brings to it the illumination of technical art history, combining an authoritative understanding of artists materials and how they were used with the history of their availability and practical application. Her focused investigation of process, or the work of art, is enriched by the latest developments in conservation science, archival research in the history of art materials and close visual examination of paintings, as well as by her own practice as a painter.&#x201d; (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The rise of painting <i>en plein air</i> was a key change in French artistic practice in the nineteenth century. This study examines how this new approach informed the avant garde, leading to the Impressionist revolution.&#x201d; (<i>Apollo Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Callen&#x2019;s <i>The Work of Art</i> is a welcome return to the material and technical matter of Impressionist paintings. . . . Callen skillfully interweaves performative, social, and aesthetic evidence that propelled the identity-construct of male plein-air landscape painters. The author casts her evidential net wide. . . . Particularly compelling is that these tangents converge on the multilayered identity of (male) plein-air painters as manual laborers. . . . Callen&#x2019;s eloquent descriptions of the painting and knifing process mirror the tactile plasticity of the thick pigments on the canvases she describes. Likewise, the author&#x2019;s lively prose captures the dynamics of hand and tool movements not only as indexical marks of the making process, but also of the changing components of manufactured pigments. . . . We can conclude from Callen&#x2019;s densely demonstrated deconstruction of Impressionist practices and the tactile materiality of the painted canvases that the complex manufacture of Impressionist paintings compels a sense of wonder. Indeed, Callen&#x2019;s book is a testimony to the Impressionists&#x2019; achievement.&#x201d; (<i>Nineteenth-Century French Studies</i>)</p><h2>Le Corbusier: Houses</h2><p>Charles-�douard Jeanneret, otherwise known as the Swiss architect Le Corbusier, is famous for proclaiming &#34;&#34;the house is a machine for living in&#34;&#34;.

Renowned philosopher Paul Edwards exposes the many flaws in the arguments supporting the belief in reincarnation and the so-called Law of Karma. He also covers the alleged evidence in support of reincarnation, including child prodigies, deja vu experiences, hypnotic regressions, and &#34;reincarnation memories.&#34; Finally, he discusses in some detail the claims of the leading figures in the recent immortality movement, in particular Elisabeth Kuebler-Ross, Raymond Moody, and Dr. Stanislov Grof. Edwards&#39; wit and clarity make this a fascinating, accessible, and enjoyable work.</p><p>"It is a breath of fresh air to have at long last a systematic examination of these strange Eastern beliefs. No one could have done the job better than Paul Edwards. His arguments are devastating, his references voluminous, his scholarship awesome." -- Martin Gardner <p>"Paul Edwards brings his usual incisiveness, clarity, and wit to bear on ancient beliefs that underlie much of the fuzzy thinking of the New Age movement. He deftly exposes the philosophical and practical deficiencies of the concept of Karma and provides a trenchant critique of the evidence in favor of reincarnation." -- Barry Beyerstein</p>Paul Edwards (1923-2004) was the author of God and the Philosophers, Heidegger&#39;s Confusions, Reincarnation: A Critical Examination, The Logic of Moral Discourse, and Heidegger and Death.

Until foolishly, we unleashed the terrible Gandiva Weapon upon Earth, sending a wave of destructive radiation out into the galaxy to incur the ire of the Inter-Galactic Federation.

World War II had ended, and numerous players who had served in the military returned to resume their playing careers with the Eagles. The returning veterans composed a veritable &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Who in the Negro Leagues&#x201d; and included Leon Day, Larry Doby, Monte Irvin, and Max Manning, as well as numerous role players.

This book, which was researched and written exclusively by more than 30 members of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), presents not only the famous individuals, but also tells the tales of the other stars and the lesser-known players insofar as history allows them to be revealed. In addition to biographies of the players, co-owners, and P.A. announcer, there are also articles about Newark&#x2019;s Ruppert Stadium, Leon Day&#x2019;s Opening Day no-hitter, a sensational midseason game, the season&#x2019;s two East-West All-Star games, and the 1946 Negro League World Series between the Eagles and the renowned Kansas City Monarchs. A season timeline and a history of the Eagles&#x2019; years in Newark help to present the entire context of the team and its lone championship season. Includes over 60 historic photos.

Just as corporatization and the lowest-common-denominator pursuit of the bottom line have had a parlous effect on publishing, media consolidation has contributed to the ongoing demise of serious journalism in newspapers, magazines, serious broadcast news, and online journalism. Schiffrin compares the media crisis in the United States to the situation in Europe and across the globe, and he demonstrates how the American corporate model has extended its reach. But he also describes and considers a range of alternative policies culled from many countries that, if pursued, could help to save journalism and the media in the US. This is a superlative essay that will make everyone seriously interested in the media and publishing think again.</p><p><b>Andr� Schiffrin</b> was, for thirty years, the publisher of Pantheon Books. In 1990 Schiffrin left Pantheon to found The New Press. He is the author of <i>The Business of Books, Words and Money, A Political Education</i>, and <i>Dr. Seuss &amp; Co.

But ultimately we feel the artist&#x2019;s relationship with the land, a connection that is full of love, beauty, and above all, reverence. These are portraits of places and moments deep in the heart of the Central Valley, places that resonate in the photographer&#x2019;s art. Stark visions of freshwater marshes, valley oak woodlands, rain-swollen streams, and other scenes reveal themselves to us. Visually stunning and sometimes ephemeral, they are testaments to the workings of the human heart and psyche. </p><p>_Two-Hearted Oak_ will delight anyone with an appreciation for nature and the art of photography.

In this memoir, full of revelatory and previously unknown anecdotal observations of these musical giants, Glenn recounts how he quickly learned the ropes to move up from schlepperhood to assistant to the tyrannical Ramone, and eventually, to become a recording engineer superstar himself. Not only is <i>Never Say No to A Rock Star</i> a fascinating, hilarious and poignant behind-the-scenes look of this musical Mecca, but Berger, now a prominent psychologist, looking back through the prism of his youthful experience and his years working as a counselor and therapist, provides a telling and honest examination of the nature of fame and success and the corollaries between creativity, madness and self-destruction.</p><p><b>Glenn Berger, PhD</b> was for many years in the 1970s and 80s a recording assistant and later engineer/producer for the recording studio A&amp;R Studios.

Born and raised in England, she now lives in Eugene, Oregon.It's 1923 in postWW I England, and the Honorable Philip Petrie--aimless, car-loving younger son of an aristocratic family- -meets Gloria Arbuckle, daughter of an American millionaire, in the countryside near Malvern. It's love at first sight, but a second meeting ends with the kidnapping of Gloria, a failed attempt by Philip to rescue her, and a note from the kidnappers to Arbuckle demanding a huge ransom and utter secrecy. Philip enlists the help of the intrepid Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, a childhood friend and neighbor in the woodlands where Gloria and her captors are holed up. Daisy resists the temptation to bring her beloved Detective Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard into the picture. She eventually finds the captors' well-hidden shack but then is captured herself. Her escape, leaving Gloria behind, forces the kidnappers to move their hideaway, and now Fletcher, along with some of Daisy's trusted friends and servants, band together to ensure Gloria's safe return while her father arranges the money pick-up and Fletcher successfully figures out who's behind it all.

E. Lawrence gained global attention, both for his involvement in the Middle Eastern anti-imperialist movement, and for his vivid and sensational writings about his experiences. Despite the passage of many years and the emergence of a whole new set of problems in the Middle East, and fuelled by the success of the hit movie Lawrence of Arabia, the T. E. Lawrence mystique continues to fascinate. Controversial and provocative, this revised and updated edition of Lawrence James&#x2019;s acclaimed biography penetrates and overturns the mythology that surrounds T. E. Lawrence. James traces the sometimes spurious Lawrence legend back to its truthful roots, yet remains dispassionate and generous in spirit throughout. The Golden Warrior presents readers with a fascinating study of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most remarkable figures.</p><p>Lawrence James is a former teacher and the author of several books, including the successful The Rise and Fall of Britain. He lives in Scotland.<strong><i>&#x201c;James&#x2019;s narrative is readable, his research wide-ranging and his judgments informed and tough-minded.&#x201d;</i><br>&nbsp;</strong> (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> )<br><br>The image of the British hero soldier T. (Thomas) E. (Edward) Lawrence (1888-1935) is tarnished by James ( The Savage Wars: The British Conquest of Africa, 1870-1920 ). The biographer, who obtained access to formerly unavailable documents, controversially posits in his carefully researched study that Lawrence's WW I military activites to spur an Arab revolt against the Turks, in order to assist the allied forces, was a public relations coup rather than a military victory. Although Lawrence was brave under fire, he identified with the Arab cause to such an extent, James relates, that he compromised the truth in his articles and books written after the war ( Seven Pillars of Wisdom ) and, with the assistance of American journalist Lowell Thomas, created his own largely fictional image as a romantic war hero. James concurs with other researchers who have revealed Lawrence's story of his capture and rape by the Turks at Dera as a lie. Illustrated. <br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>The only thing more surprising than the number and flow of T.E. Lawrence biographies is the Rashomonesque quality to the works. From early hero worship to the most foul denigration to a more moderate, modern view of this gifted, tortured man, Lawrenciana has run the gamut. James, author of numerous histories, has placed his own peculiar interpretation on Lawrence's life: that of active homosexual. James has used his own modest skills to try to convince the reader that the repressed, almost asexual Lawrence was just the opposite. James's results are at best mixed, and he adds very little to what is already known about, in any area. Readers and libraries would be better off consulting editions of Lawrence's letters and works such as John F. Mack's A Prince of Our Disorder ( LJ 4/1/76) and Jeremy Wilson's more recent Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorized Biography ( LJ 6/15/90).<br><i>- Katherine Gillen, Mesa P.L., Ariz.</i><br>&nbsp; (<i>Library Journal</i> )</p><h2>Art of the Middle Ages (World of Art)</h2><p>A general introduction to the art, and architecture, of medieval Europe from the Early Christian to Late Gothic period.

It was first published as a book in 1902, having been expanded from a series of stories published in the Strand Magazine in 1900 under the general title The Psammead, or the Gifts. It is the first volume of a trilogy that includes The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904) and The Story of the Amulet (1906). The book has never been out of print since its initial publication.Like Nesbit's The Railway Children, the story begins when a group of children move from London to the countryside of Kent. The five children &#x2013; Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane, and their baby brother, known as the Lamb &#x2013; are playing in a gravel pit when they uncover a rather grumpy, ugly, and occasionally malevolent Psammead or sand-fairy, who has the ability to grant wishes. He persuades the children to take one wish each day to be shared among them, with the caveat that the wishes will turn to stone at sunset. This, apparently, used to be the rule in the Stone Age, when all that children wished for was food, the bones of which then became fossils. The five children's first wish is to be "as beautiful as the day". The wish ends at sunset and its effects simply vanish, leading the Psammead to observe that some wishes are too fanciful to be changed to stone.</p><p>The five children find a cantankerous sand fairy or &#39;psammead&#39; in a gravel pit. Every day &#39;It&#39; will grant each of them a wish that lasts until sunset, often with disastrous consequences. Five Children and It was first published in 1902, and it has remained in print ever since. The Introduction to this edition examines Nesbit&#39;s life and her reading, showing how she was poised between the Victorian world and a new era in which children in literature were no longer mere projections of the adult viewpoint. Sandra Kemp examines how the narrative is structured around the acting out of literary fantasies, which always come down to earth. Nesbit combines wonderfully implausible events with the prosaic and familiar, and Kemp illuminates her exploration of the shifting relationship between imagination, literature, and life.Edith Nesbit (1858&amp;ndash1924) was a children's writer whose most famous novels include The Story of the Treasure Seekers, Five Children and It, and The Enchanted Castle.</p><h2>Touching the Wild: Living with the Mule Deer of Deadman Gulch</h2><p>In Illumination in the Flatwoods, Joe Hutto unveiled the secret lives of wild turkeys to great critical acclaim, which resulted in the Emmy Award&#x2013;winning PSB documentary My Life as a Turkey. Now Hutto has done it again. Touching the Wild is the enchanting story about one man who has lived with a herd of mule deer in the Rockies for almost seven years.<br>Due to the intense curiosity of one groundbreaking deer, and the resulting introduction to an entire herd, Joe Hutto has been allowed unprecedented access and insight into the minds and behavior of this special animal. Spending every day embedded among the herd, he develops an uncanny connection with the deer, witnessing individual and group dynamics never before observed and recorded, unveiling just how much we have in common with these delicate beings.<br>Each season brings joy as fawns are born, and heartache as hunters, predators, development, and a pollution all take their toll. The mule deer of the West are in trouble, and Hutto is their most fervent advocate. Touching the Wild is proof that we have so much to learn from wild animals about their world, ourselves, and the fragile planet we share. Full color photos throughout.</p><p>Joe Hutto is an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning filmmaker, writer, and naturalist. He is the author such critically acclaimed books as Illumination in the Flatwoods and The Light in High Places, and wrote two award-winning films: My Life as a Turkey, and Touching the Wild, both PBS/Nature documentaries. He lived in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming in an historic ranch among the mule deer for nearly a decade. He now lives in the Florida Panhandle immersed in the stunning ecology of carnivorous plants.*Starred Review* Well known for Illumination in the Flatwoods (2006), which describes his two years living with and studying wild turkeys, Hutto has also intimately observed wood ducks, bighorn sheep, and other animals. A move to an old ranch in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming brought him into contact with the resident mule deer, and a particularly friendly doe initiated contact with him and his wife, eventually bringing her family group into their yard. Thus began a seven-year study of the deer as Hutto habituated them to his presence and was able to integrate himself into their society. Recognizing individuals allowed him to discern family relationships and to observe how the deer conducted their day-to-day lives, and by noting subtle changes in behavior, he was able to learn what they meant. Naming the deer by physical traits and their personalities, Hutto makes the individuals very accessible for readers, who not only will learn quite a bit of mule deer ecology but also care about their fate. Full of color photographs of Hutto with the deer, this companion book to an upcoming documentary on PBS&#x2019; Nature will charm anyone who has ever enjoyed a distant view of deer. --Nancy Bent</p><h2>Sanctuary</h2><p>While visiting Rome, world-renowned photographer Gregory Crewdson was invited to tour the legendary film studio Cinecitt�, where directors such as Federico Fellini and Roberto Rossellini shot their iconic works. He found the elaborate film sets fallen into ruin and, captivated by their beauty, chose them as the subject of his next body of work. Although his earlier series were characterized by large production crews, custom-built soundstages, and hired actors, Crewdson returned to Rome with only a small team to create the haunting black-and-white portraits of deteriorating buildings and deserted streets that are flawlessly reproduced in this book. Admirers of Crewdson&#x2019;s work will find these new photographs are a bold departure, which yet convey the dramatic subtext and charged emotions that characterize his earlier works.<p></p><p></p></p><p>Gregory Crewdson is an internationally exhibited artist whose previous books with Abrams include <i>Beneath the Roses </i>and <i>Twilight</i>. He teaches at the Yale University School of Art and lives in New York City. <p></p><br> &nbsp;<p></p><br> A. O. Scott has been a film critic for the <i>New York Times </i>since 2000 and began his tenure as cohost of the television program <i>At the Movies </i>in 2009.<p></p><br> <p></p>Starred Review. In these 40 black-and-white photographs, Crewdson (Beneath the Roses) travels to Rome's Cinecitt� studio, home to some of the most famous works of Italian cinema. While Crewdson emphasizes the artificiality of a film set (and the photographic medium itself) by portraying the Cinecitt� as a composition of gray tonalities, he also suggests the possibility of movement and life, and teases us with nonsensical elements that prevent the sequence from forming a coherent narrative: a small set of stairs leads to nowhere, dull light casts shadows through a distant doorway, and Roman architecture stands next to modern scaffolding. As film critic A.O. Scott notes in his lyrical preface, Crewdson--like the discontinuous world of the unconscious--gives us "the sense that what we are looking at is both actual and illusory." Unlike Crewdson's previous work, those color-saturated shots like film stills, this collection addresses the dream world of film in a historically significant setting, but the relationship with the viewer remains intimate, as he or she becomes "the solitary walker tiptoeing through secret places and dreaming fragmentary epics." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its membership was mostly comprised of the younger members of the aristocracy, who considered it a livelier place than the other stuffy gentlemen's clubs of London.</p><p>Some of them felt that the acceptance of Captain Harry Cathcart into The Club was a grave mistake. When he had left for the Boer War, he had been a handsome, easygoing man. But he had returned, invalided out of the army, bitter, brooding and taciturn, and he seemed unable to converse in anything other than clich�s or grunts.</p><p>One warm spring day, when a mellow sun was gilding the sooty buildings and the first trembling green leaves were appearing on the plane trees down the Mall, Freddy Pomfret and Tristram Baker-Willis entered The Club and looked with deep disfavour on the long figure of the captain, who was slumped in an armchair.</p><p>"Look at that dismal face," said Freddy, not bothering to lower his voice. "Enough to put a fellow off his dinner, what?"</p><p>"Needs the love of a bad woman," brayed Tristam. "Eh, Harry. What? Rather neat that, don't you think? Love of a bad woman, what?"</p><p>The captain, by way of reply, leaned forward, picked up the Times and barricaded himself behind it. He wanted peace and quiet to think what to do with his life. He lowered his paper once he was sure his tormentors had gone. A large mirror opposite showed him his reflection. He momentarily studied himself and then sighed. He was only twenty-eight and yet it was a face from which any sign of youth had fled. His thick black hair was showing a trace of grey at the temples. His hard and handsome face had black heavy-lidded eyes which gave nothing away. He moved his leg to ease it. His old wound still throbbed and hurt on the bad days, and this was one of them.</p><p>He was the youngest son of Baron Derrington, existing on his army pension and a small income from the family trust. His social life was severely curtailed. On his return from the war, he had been invited out to various dinner parties and dances, but the invitations faded away as he became damned as a bore who rarely opened his mouth and who did not know how to flirt with the ladies.</p><p>He put the Times back down on the table in front of him, and as he did so, he saw there was a copy of the Daily Mail lying there. Someone must have brought it in, for The Club would never supply a popular paper. There was a photograph on the front of a suffragette demonstration in Trafalgar Square and an oval insert of a pretty young girl with the caption, "Lady Rose, daughter of the Earl of Hadshire, joined the demonstrators."</p><p>Brave girl, thought the captain. That's her social life ruined. He put the paper down again and forgot about her.</p><p>But Lady Rose was possessed of exceptional beauty and a large dowry, so a month later her parents felt confident that her support for the suffragettes would not be much of a barrier to marriage. After all, the very idea of women getting the vote was a joke, and so they had told her, in no uncertain terms. They had moved to their town house in Eaton Square and lectured their daughter daily on where her duty lay. A season was a vast expense and England expected every girl to do her duty and capture a husband during it.</p><p>Normally, the independently-minded Lady Rose would have balked at this. She had been refusing a season, saying it was nothing more than a cattle market, when, to the delight of her parents, she suddenly caved in.</p><p>The reason for this was because Lady Rose had met Sir Geoffrey Blandon at a pre-season party and had fallen in love--first love, passionate all-consuming love.</p><p>He appeared to return her affections. He was rich and extremely handsome. Lady Rose was over-educated for her class, and her obvious contempt for her peers had given her the nickname The Ice Queen. But to her parents' relief, Sir Geoffrey appeared to be enchanted by their clever daughter. Certainly Rose, with her thick brown hair, perfect figure, delicate complexion and large blue eyes, had enough attributes to make anyone fall for her.</p><p>But the fact was that her support for the suffragettes had indeed damaged her socially, and it seemed as if Sir Geoffrey had the field to himself. Resentment against Rose was growing in the gentlemen's clubs and over the port at dinner parties after the ladies had retired. Suffragettes were simply men-haters. They needed to be taught a lesson. "What that gal needs," Freddy Pomfret was heard to remark, "is some rumpy-pumpy."</p><p>As the season got underway and social event followed social event, the earl began to become extremely anxious. He felt that by now Sir Geoffrey should have declared his intentions.</p><p>One day at his club, he met an old friend, Brigadier Bill Handy, and over a decanter of port after a satisfying lunch, the earl said, "I'd give anything to know if Geoffrey means to pop the question."</p><p>The brigadier studied him for a long moment and then said, "I think you should be careful there. Blandon's always been a bit of a rake and a gambler. Tell you what. Do you know Captain Cathcart?"</p><p>"Vaguely. Only heard of him. Sinister sort of chap who never opens his mouth?"</p><p>"That's the one. Now he did some undercover work behind the lines in the war. You mustn't mention this."</p><p>"I'm a clam."</p><p>"All right. Here's what I'll do. I'll give you my card and scribble something on the back of it. I'll give you his address. Pop round there and ask him to check up on Blandon. It's worth it. Rose is your only daughter. They say she talks like an encyclopaedia. Wouldn't have thought that would fascinate Blandon. How did you come to make such a mistake?"</p><p>"Not my fault," said the earl huffily. "My wife got her this governess and left the instruction to her."</p><p>"I hear that Lady Rose is a member of the Shrieking Sisterhood," remarked the brigadier, using the nickname for the suffragettes.</p><p>"Not any more, she ain't," said the earl. "Mind you, I think the only reason she lost interest was because of Blandon."</p><p>"Well, maybe there is something to be said for love, though I don't hold with it. A girl should marry background and money. They last, love don't. Here's my card." He wrote an address down and handed it over.</p><p>The earl put his monocle in his eye and studied it. "I say, old man. Chelsea? No place for a gentleman."</p><p>"If Captain Cathcart were the complete gentleman he wouldn't dream of doing your snooping for you. But you'll be safe with him."</p><p>Lady Rose was at that moment fretting under the ministrations of her lady's maid. Having abandoned the Sisterhood--but only briefly, she told herself--Rose had once more subjected herself to the stultifying dress code of Edwardian society. While she had been supporting the suffragette movement, she had worn simple skirts and blouses and a straw hat. But now she was dressed in layers of silk underclothes, starched petticoats and elaborate gowns with waterfalls of lace. Her figure was too slim to suit the fashion of ripe and luscious beauty, and so art was brought to bear to create the small-waisted, S-shaped figure. A beauty had to have an outstanding bust and a noticeable posterior. Rose was lashed into a long corset and then put into a Dip Front Adjuster, a waist-cinch that stressed the fashionable about-to-topple-over appearance. Her bottom was padded, as was her bust. By the time the maid had slung a rope of pearls around Rose's neck and decorated the bosom of her gown with brooches, Rose felt she looked like a tray in a jeweller's window.</p><p>Geoffrey always praised her appearance but had implied that once she was married, she would be free to wear more comfortable clothes. Rose stared at the mirror as the maid put in pompadours, the pads over which her long hair would be drawn up and arranged. Sir Geoffrey had said nothing about when we are married. But he had stolen a kiss, just the other night, behind a pillar in the Jessingtons' ballroom, and stealing a kiss was tantamount to a proposal of marriage.</p><p>The captain lived in a thin white house in Water Street, off the King's Road. The earl fervently hoped that the man was a gentleman and not some sort of Neverwazzer who wore a bowler hat or carried a coloured handkerchief in his breast pocket or--horror upon horrors--brown boots with a dark suit. He had never met him but had heard about him in the clubs.</p><p>The earl climbed stiffly down from his carriage and waited while his footman rapped at the door. To his relief, the earl saw that the door was opened by a sober-looking gentleman's gentleman who took the earl's card, carefully turned down at one corner to show the earl was calling in person, put it on a silver tray, and retreated into the house.</p><p>The earl frowned. His title should have been enough to grant him instant admission.</p><p>The captain's servant returned after only a few moments and spoke to the footman, who sprinted down the stairs to tell the earl that the captain would be pleased to receive him.</p><p>The earl was ushered into a room on the ground floor. He was announced, and a tall saturnine man who had been sitting in a chair by the window rose to meet him.</p><p>"May we offer you something?" asked Captain Cathcart. "Sherry?"</p><p>"Fine, fine," mumbled the earl, taken aback by the amount of books in the shelves lining the room. His Majesty, King Edward, set such a good example by not opening a book from one year's end to another. Why couldn't everyone follow such a fine example?</p><p>"Sherry, Becket," said the captain to his manservant. And to the earl, "Do sit down, sir. I see the sun has come out at last."</p><p>"So it has," said the earl, who hadn't noticed. "I come on a delicate matter." He handed over the brigadier's card.</p><p>"What matter?"</p><p>"Well, y'see--" The earl broke off as the manservant reentered the room with glasses and decanter on a tray. He poured two glasses and handed one to the captain and one to the earl.</p><p>"That will be all," said the captain and Becket noiselessly retreated.</p><p>The captain turned his fathomless black gaze on the earl, wondering why he had come. The earl was a small round man dressed in a frock-coat and grey trousers. He had a round, reddish face and blue eyes which had a childlike look about them.</p><p>"It's like this," said the earl, feeling awkward and embarrassed. "I have a daughter, Rose..."</p><p>"Ah, the suffragette."</p><p>"I thought people had forgotten about that," said the earl. "Anyway, Rose is being courted by Sir Geoffrey Blandon. He's not an adventurer. Good family. Nothing wrong there."</p><p>"And the problem?"</p><p>"He hasn't proposed. Rose is my only child. Would like some discreet chap to check up on Blandon. Find out if he's the thing. I mean, does he have a mistress who might turn awkward? That sort of business."</p><p>Having got it out, the little earl turned scarlet with embarrassment and took a gulp of sherry.</p><p>"I am not much out in the world these days," said the captain, "but knowing how gossip flies about, I would have thought if there was anything unsavoury about the man, you'd have heard it."</p><p>"Blandon's been in America for the past four years, came back in time for this season. Might be something nobody knows about. Handy says he's a gambler."</p><p>Captain Cathcart studied him for a long moment and then said, "A thousand pounds."</p><p>"What, what?" gabbled the earl.</p><p>"That is my fee for research and discretion."</p><p>The earl was shocked. This captain was a baron's son and yet here he was asking for money like a tradesman. And yet, why hadn't Blandon declared his intentions? He was spoiling Rose's chances of finding another suitor.</p><p>The captain let the silence last. A carriage rattled over the cobbles on the street outside and a small fire crackled on the hearth. A clock on the mantel ticked away the minutes.</p><p>"Very well," said the earl with a cold stare.</p><p>"In advance," said the captain mildly.</p><p>The earl goggled at him. "You have my word."</p><p>The captain smiled and said nothing.</p><p>The earl capitulated. "I'll give you a draft on my bank."</p><p>"You may use my desk."</p><p>The earl went over to a desk at the window and scribbled busily. He handed the draft to the captain and said angrily, "If there's nothing wrong, it'll be a waste of money."</p><p>"I should think to be reassured on the subject of your only daughter would be worth anything."</p><p>"Harrumph. I'm going. Report to me as soon as you can," snapped the earl.</p><p>The captain waited until Becket had ushered the earl out and then smiled at his manservant. "My coat and hat, Becket. I am going to the bank. I will have your overdue wages when I get back."</p><p>"That is most gratifying, sir."</p><p>At that moment, Rose was taking tea at the home of her mother's friend, Mrs. Cummings, in Belgrave Square. She looked dismally at the small butter stain on one of her kid gloves, and, for seemingly the hundredth time, damned the mad rules of society, one of which was that a lady should not remove her gloves when taking tea. Although the bread and butter had been carefully rolled, a spot had got onto one of her gloves. Most ladies avoided the problem by simply not eating. What insanity, thought Rose bitterly. She had a healthy appetite and the spread before her was of the usual staggering proportions. Apart from the bread-and-butter, there were ham, tongue, anchovy, egg-and-cress and foie gras sandwiches; chicken cutlets and oyster canap�s. And then the cakes: Savoy, Madeira, Victoria and Genoa, along with French pastries, to be followed by petits fours, banana cream, chocolate cream and strawberry ice cream. And all of it sitting there mostly untouched so that the ladies would not soil their gloves.</p><p>Did no one but herself notice the poor on the streets of London? she wondered. And again she felt that uncomfortable feeling of isolation as she assumed she was probably the only person in society who did notice. Geoffrey, dear Geoffrey, did have some idea. He had told her that only the other day, the Duke of Devonshire had been visiting a bazaar with his agent and had stopped at a stall displaying wooden napkin rings and the duke had asked his agent what they were for.</p><p>"Napkin rings," said the agent. "Middle-class people keep them on the table to put their table napkins in between meals."</p><p>Said the astounded duke, "Do you mean that people actually wrap up their napkins and use them again for another meal?"</p><p>"Certainly," said the agent.</p><p>The duke gasped as he looked at the stall, "Good God!" he exclaimed. "I never knew such poverty existed."</p><p>How Geoffrey had laughed at such idiocy. If only he would propose. She knew her parents were beginning to fret. She glanced at her mother, who was chatting amiably with her hostess. The countess had moaned before they had left for the tea party that she should never have allowed that "dreadful" governess to over-educate her child. What a world where intelligence was regarded with such deep suspicion. Poor Miss Tremp. Such a fine governess. She had moved on to another household. When I am married, I will take her out of servitude and make her my companion, thought Rose. And I will be married, she told herself firmly. The Duke of Freemount's ball was to take place the following week, the grandest affair of the season, and Geoffrey had whispered that he had something to ask her and he would put the question to her there. What else could he mean? But on the other hand, why had he not approached her father and asked permission to pay his addresses?</p><p>Harry Cathcart decided to start...</p></p><h2>Sensible Footwear: A Girl&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Sensible Footwear is a glorious political and personal history that gives Pride a run for its money; but, like Pride, it wears its heart at the centre, making the invisible visible, and celebrating lesbian lives from the domestic to the diva. Before today&#39;s LGBTQI universe expanded from the Big Bang of Stonewall, postwar Britain was like so much of the world today, hostile towards and virtually in denial (and worse) to anything we might now call queer. In 1950 male homosexuality carried a custodial sentence; blackmail, violence and the fear of exposure were ever-present. Female homosexuality had never been an offence in the UK, effectively rendering lesbians even more invisible than they already were - often to themselves. Most who knew they were &#39;different&#39;, or came to that realisation later on, often felt they were the only ones to feel that way. Growing up in the North was a rich and colourful experience for Kate Charlesworth, but at the time there were very few signposts to difference. Like countless other girls and women, Kate took what role models were on offer, and failing that, made them up, in the spirit of that classic old dyke joke: &#39;What do lesbians use?&#39; &#39;Their imagination...&#39;</p><p></p><h2>Round About the Earth: Circumnavigation from Magellan to Orbit</h2><p><b>With illustrations and maps, a witty and erudite account of the history of circumnavigation and how it has influenced the way we think about the Earth and ourselves. In the first complete account, Joyce Chaplin tells of the outrageous ambitions that inspired men and women to take on the whole planet.</b><br><br><b>In this first full history of around-the-world travel, Joyce E. Chaplin brilliantly tells the story of circumnavigation. Round About the Earth is a witty, erudite, and colorful account of the outrageous ambitions that have inspired men and women to circle the entire planet.</b> <br><br>For almost five hundred years, human beings have been finding ways to circle the Earth&#x2014;by sail, steam, or liquid fuel; by cycling, driving, flying, going into orbit, even by using their own bodily power. The story begins with the first centuries of circumnavigation, when few survived the attempt: in 1519, Ferdinand Magellan left Spain with five ships and 270 men, but only one ship and thirty-five men returned, not including Magellan, who died in the Philippines. Starting with these dangerous voyages, Joyce Chaplin takes us on a trip of our own as we travel with Francis Drake, William Dampier, Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, and James Cook. <br><br>Eventually sea travel grew much safer and passengers came on board. The most famous was Charles Darwin, but some intrepid women became circumnavigators too&#x2014;a Lady Brassey, for example. Circumnavigation became a fad, as captured in Jules Verne&#x2019;s classic novel, <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i>. <br><br>Once continental railroads were built, circumnavigators could traverse sea and land. Newspapers sponsored racing contests, and people sought ways to distinguish themselves&#x2014;by bicycling around the world, for instance, or by sailing solo. <br><br>Steamships turned round-the-world travel into a luxurious experience, as with the tours of Thomas Cook &amp; Son. Famous authors wrote up their adventures, including Mark Twain and Jack London and Elizabeth Jane Cochrane (better known as Nellie Bly). Finally humans took to the skies to circle the globe in airplanes. Not much later, Sputnik, Gagarin, and Glenn pioneered a new kind of circumnavigation&#x2014; in orbit. <br><br>Through it all, the desire to take on the planet has tested the courage and capacity of the bold men and women who took up the challenge. Their exploits show us why we think of the Earth as home. <i>Round About the Earth </i>is itself a thrilling adventure.</p><p><b>Joyce E. Chaplin</b> is the James Duncan Phillips Professor of History at Harvard University. She is the author of four previous books of nonfiction, including <i>The First Scientific American: Benjamin Franklin and the Pursuit of Genius</i> (2006), a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize (Science and Technology Category), and winner of the Annibel Jenkins Prize of American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.<i>Prologue</i><br> <br>I&#x2019;ll put a girdle round about the Earth<br> <br>In forty minutes . . .<br> <br><i>&#x2014;Puck,</i> A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream<br> <br>I<i>magine that you</i> have purchased, to accompany this book, a model of a theater in which you can stage your very own around-the-world voyage. The whole setup will require special delivery because, for some reason, the theater, which is round, turns out to be about 8.25 meters in circumference (just under 9 feet across). That is only the first of several Alice-in-Wonderland surprises, as you discover when you enter the theater, which seems empty. Luckily, there is an envelope pinned to the theater door which contains a map, with &#x201c;X&#x201d; marking the spot where you can find the most important piece of scenery, the small ship that will make a staged circumnavigation. Once you locate the X, you must remove a magnifying glass (helpfully provided in the envelope) to see the ship. It is the size of the head of a pin and scattered with what look like bits of dust. Nearby is a microscope, and only with its assistance can you make out that the dust particles are actually tiny dolls that represent the ship&#x2019;s sailors.<br> <br>The theater kit has these odd components and dimensions because, correctly proportioned to each other, the theater is the Earth, the pinhead ship is the <i>Victoria</i>, the first ship to go around the world, and the near-invisible dolls within her represent sailors, the angels that dance on the head of this particular pin. Given the high mortality rates during most of the history of around-the-world travel, sailors were indeed angels in the making. Their tininess, and that of their ship, make a circumnavigation of the enormous globe seem impossible. And yet it happened, over and over, hundreds of thousands of times, and even more circumnavigations are taking place right now, as you read.<br> <br>With those repeated embraces of the globe, from 1519 onward, human beings have established what is now a nearly five-hundred-year history of going around the world. It is the longest tradition of a human activity done on a planetary scale. Around-the-world travelers make a grand gesture, as big as the physical world itself, even though they are individually so small that the huge global stage on which they act makes them hard to find.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I found this book in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Six years ago, in St. George&#x2019;s, Bermuda, I embarked on a 140-foot sailing ship, the Sea Education Association&#x2019;s SSV <i>Corwith Cramer</i>. I would be at sea for three weeks, away from telephone, Internet, and physical libraries. Yet I was in the middle of a research project on Benjamin Franklin that required me to read material in French. I decided to use my time at sea to revive my French by reading a novel in that language. The book I chose was a small paperback edition of Jules Verne&#x2019;s <i>Le Tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours,</i> or <i>Around the World in Eighty Days,</i> first published as a newspaper serial in 1872. When I wasn&#x2019;t on watch or otherwise busy, I slowly made my way through the book.<br> <br>My French was good enough&#x2014;to my surprise&#x2014;that I actually enjoyed the story and, as a historian, I appreciated its period detail, especially the nature of the bet that sends Verne&#x2019;s protagonist, the Englishman Phileas Fogg, racing around the world. At his London club, Fogg remarks that scheduled travel services could take a person around the globe in a period of eighty days. Prove it, the club men challenge him, and he&#x2019;s off. That eighty-day measure was only conceivable by the late nineteenth century. In the age of sail, getting around the world had taken months or years. (The speed of my sailing ship would have lost Fogg his wager.) It was the invention of steampower, but also the creation of regimented European empires around the globe, the opening of the Suez Canal, and the emergence of commercial travel services that together made it just possible, by the 1870s, to do the global circuit in eighty days.<br> <br>The second thing that impressed me about Verne&#x2019;s story was how the material developments that sped up global travel required a dramatically increased use of natural resources. When Fogg leaves London, he takes his new valet (and invaluable comic foil) Passepartout. The two men board a night train which has scarcely departed London when Passepartout lets out &#x201c;a real cry of despair&#x201d;:<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . in the rush . . . my state of confusion . . . I forgot . . . to switch off the gas lamp in my bedroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, my dear fellow,&#x201d; Phileas Fogg replied coldly, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll be paying the bill.&#x201d; The gas lamp is the novel&#x2019;s running joke. True, it is a small part of the journey&#x2019;s cost, but we present-day readers of Verne quickly realize that the joke is on us. We are, notoriously, the first generation that has realized what the planetary bill for centuries of burning fossil fuel is going to be.1<br> <br>In Verne&#x2019;s era, coal was a costly but essential part of modern progress. Yet Fogg&#x2019;s steam-powered exploits, set at the height of European imperialism, represent a phase of the past that truly is history, over and done with. Airplanes have replaced the coal-burning engines and ships that hurtled Fogg around the world; the empires that protected some people at the expense of others have been replaced with other political regimes. It&#x2019;s now difficult to cross the surface of the world in eighty days, though easy to fly around it in hours, if you can afford the <br> ticket.<br> <br>Back on land, I looked for a history of around-the-world travel. There was none. Two books have given narrative histories of circumnavigations, but only in the age of sail; a third book examines some nineteenth-century examples, among other long-distance voyages; a fourth looks at small-boat circumnavigations in the early twentieth century. That&#x2019;s not much. For that reason, there is no separate Library of Congress heading for histories of around-the-world travel&#x2014;the histories are simply lumped with first-person accounts of the travelers. There are many more studies of individual around-the-world travels, especially the really famous attempts by Magellan, Cook, Earhart, Gagarin, Chichester, and others. There are analyses of fictional circumnavigators, including Fogg, and even Shakespeare&#x2019;s Puck. And there is Raymond John Howgego&#x2019;s incomparable <i>Encyclopedia of Exploration</i>, which includes historical circumnavigations among its thousands of entries. Finally, there are other encyclopedias that chronicle circumnavigations or orbital travels or, especially in electronic form, just list the journeys themselves.2<br> <br>All of these works take for granted that an around-the-world voyage represents a distinct human activity, something unlike other voyages or expeditions. But none of them explains <i>why</i> they are distinctive. Why do they matter?<br> <br>The answer is not obvious. To find out what is different about around-the-world voyages requires setting aside everything they might have in common with other kinds of travel and exploration. Circumnavigators made geographic discoveries; but so did other explorers. They changed the world map, but other expeditions did too. They encountered lands and people new to them; so did many others. They expanded and defended empires&#x2014;many actors did. Even if circumnavigators did more of these activities&#x2014;more geographic discoveries, more cultural encounters&#x2014;that is a difference in quantity, not quality.<br> <br>The temptation is to find an encyclopedic solution, to inventory every around-the-world journey that took place, with details of what happened on each. But a work that simply listed all of these journeys, let alone details of what happened on them, would take a great many volumes, or a vast electronic database, yet still not establish why they are special.<br> <br>They are special because any voyager who goes all the way around the world thinks of himself or herself on a planetary scale, as an actor on a stage the size of the world. This is unique. No other form of travel, and, really, hardly any other human experience, is truly planet-encompassing. In fact, an around-the-world voyage is distinctively planetary in three ways, as measured by time, space, and death.<br> <br>Around-the-world travel is <i>time</i> travel. Verne&#x2019;s <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> has as its plot twist Fogg&#x2019;s eastward progress around the globe, through which he gains a day that wins him his bet. Because of what is now called the International Date Line, the day gained or lost during an around-the-world voyage is a fundamental and unique characteristic of such a journey. Any traveler changes his or her place on the globe, but only circumnavigators change their date on the calendar. That experience reorients them in relation to the Sun, timekeeper of the hours and days on Earth and throughout the solar system. Circumnavigators were the first people to discover, by mind-blowing experience, that time is not universal but relative.<br> <br>The <i>space</i> over which a circumnavigator must travel is also distinctive because it represents the whole world, which is painfully larger than any of the individual humans who might contemplate getting around it. Shakespeare&#x2019;s Puck may have been able to zip round about the Earth with ease, but humans had to go more slowly, and they would always need a protected space around their small selves, whether physical, imagined, or both.<br> <br>It is conventional in many cultures to consider the human body as a microcosm, a smaller, metaphorical version of the world or cosmos. So too have ships been considered microcosms, little wooden worlds that ride the waves. To put a body around the world on a ship (or in another vehicle) puts these three worlds into a dynamic relationship to each other. The mismatch in size makes the encounter both comic and cosmic, as with the ill-matched theater kit that represents world, ship, and sailors in proportion to each other, with the sailors reduced to specks of dust.<br> <br>Because of the size of the planet, and the inadequacy of early sailing ships to cover global distances while protecting those within them, sailors quickly learned that a circumnavigation meant <i>death</i>. For the first 250 years, more people died than survived circumnavigations. The planet simply shrugged them off. Many forms of travel and exploration were badly dangerous, but around-the-world travel was the most consistently bad. Only by the end of the eighteenth century did circumnavigations begin to have lower mortality rates, even as their breathtaking risks have lingered as part of their mystique.<br> <br>And yet mere mortals did manage to get their tiny bodies around the vast planet in vessels that, even if bigger than the <i>Victoria</i>, were (and are) strikingly small. To commemorate their achievement, the survivors established traditions for their experience. It did not happen at once&#x2014;the first around-the-world voyage was too surprising, and only repeated successes teased out internationally observed conventions about what such journeys meant. Circumnavigators were represented in certain kinds of portraits, they were granted characteristic coats of arms, and their journeys were represented on maps and globes in particular ways.<br> <br>Above all, the stories they told about their voyages fell into certain patterns, especially by stressing the elements of time travel, planetary distance, and frequent fatalities. Circumnavigators knew they were generating a tradition. They read each others&#x2019; accounts as models for their own voyages and narratives: William Dampier read Sir Francis Drake; George Anson read Dampier; Louis-Antoine de Bougainville read Anson; Adam Johann von Krusenstern read Bougainville; Charles Darwin read Krusenstern&#x2014;and so on, even to the present day, when around-the-world sailors still read Joshua Slocum (who read Darwin). Even people who would eventually go around the world by other means&#x2014;steamships, railroads, bicycles, airplanes, spaceships&#x2014;would refer back to the longer maritime tradition on which they thought they were building.<br> <br>As a result, circumnavigators have generated nearly half a millennium&#x2019;s worth of evidence of humanity&#x2019;s direct, tangible, and conscious connection to something usually perceived in the abstract, the whole Earth. Of course, humans have had a relationship to the planet for as long as they have existed. And yet consciousness of that relationship is thought to be rather recent. Most people in the past are not supposed to have been aware of themselves on a planetary scale, except metaphorically. They are otherwise supposed to have thought small, to have been tucked into cosy patches of a larger landscape, unable even to give consistent labels to continents and oceans, and incapable of conceiving of their actions in relation to the natural world on a long time scale. It was allegedly only by the nineteenth century that mastery of the oceans and penetration into continents gave western Europeans the world&#x2019;s first version of a planetary consciousness, augmented by developments in science and geography, and complete with an understanding of enormous spaces and the swift yet long passage of geological time. And it was only supposedly with the famous Apollo 8 photographs of the Earth, taken in 1968, that humans first truly grasped their place on the Earth as a whole.3<br> <br>Today, we are hyper-aware of our connection to the planet, given our ongoing environmental crisis, most of which can be attributed to human actions in generating matter that overheats the atmosphere, or clogs land, air, and water. We use our planetary consciousness both to praise and criticize ourselves, to emphasize our greater scientific wisdom about the Earth, for example, but also to stress our unprecented transformation of it. Plus there is our sense of globalization. Surely we must have a greater awareness of the planet, given the globalized culture in which we live, the global connections we know we now have with people all over the world?<br> <br>But it may just be the case that no one has looked hard enough to find a longer history of planetary consciousness. Globalization has hogged all the attention. Global is social&#x2014;it implies the social relations that extend over the globe. In contrast, planetary is physical, implying the physical planet itself. Far more studies have focused on the former than the latter. That is because human-to-human interactions have been historians&#x2019; major focus. Only recently have human relations with the non-human parts of nature been put into dialogue with those human relationships; only recently have scholars begun to reread historical documents to discover our past sense of our place within nature. Circumnavigators&#x2019; long and self-aware tradition of engagement with the planet questions our sense of uniqueness and may teach us something worth knowing about why we think of the Earth the way we do.4<br> <br>Toward that end, this book defines around-the-world travel as a <i>geodrama</i>, from the Greek for &#x201c;Earth&#x201d; (<i>Ge</i> or <i>Gaia</i>) and for &#x201c;action&#x201d; (<i>drama</i>). Within the European countries that sponsored the first circumnavigations, there was an established tradition of considering the world as a theater: <i>theatrum mundi</i>. It was an ancient Greek idea, sustained through Roman antiquity and the Renaissance, and exemplified in Shakespeare&#x2019;s claim that &#x201c;all the world&#x2019;s a stage.&#x201d; The <i>theatrum mundi</i> was a metaphor, but around-the-world travelers made it a reality by presenting themselves as actors on a stage of planetary dimensions. Over time, circumnavigations would be presented as dramatic entertainments, first in print, then on stage, and later in film.<br> <br>Geodrama is different from geography, meaning depictions of the Earth made by writing (<i>graphos</i>).

What kind of economy would prevent Moab from becoming yet another ghost town? For more than two decades, environmentalists in southeast Utah have had a simple answer to this question: replace extractive industries&#x2014;mining, timber, and cattle&#x2014;with an economy catering to &#x201c;green&#x201d; tourists with hotels, restaurants, and bars. They feel that if these lands can be spared further degradation by huge industries, the West could begin to thrive on something cleaner and more lucrative. But Stiles sees a downside to this seemingly idyllic vision. Bringing insight based on decades of residence in Moab, he makes a provocative and compelling argument that the economy most environmentalists hail as the solution to the woes of the rural West is in fact creating an unprecedented impact of its own. In recent years, Moab and other rural towns across the West have seen a massive influx of urbanites fleeing crowded cities in search of a simpler life. Yet Stiles also observes that these transplants are often unwilling to accept the isolation and lack of services that characterize genuine rural life. Believing themselves to be liberal, sensitive, enlightened environmentalists, they nevertheless bring with them exactly the type of lifestyle and ecological impact that they sought to leave behind and, in the process, create a community that no longer serves the native inhabitants. With a blend of travelogue, local color, and geography, Stiles engages readers with folksy humor while defending the lifestyle of the &#x201c;pre-cappuccino rural Westerners&#x201d; and exposing the paradox that underlies the professed good intentions of liberal newcomers.</p><p>JIM STILES is a freelance writer and the founder and publisher of the independent newspaper Canyon Country Zephyr. He has lived in southeast Utah for more than thirty years.When the author of this humorous and provocative book moved to Moab, Utah, nearly 30 years ago, he thought he'd found the perfect "funky little town" that offered "open land, solitude, and the freedom to live an uncluttered life." But within 25 years, the place was inundated with mountain bikers, backpackers, motor homes, fast food chains, housing projects, resort hotels and all manner of promoters and developers. As in the independent newspaper he started in 1989, the <i>Canyon Country Zephyr</i>, Stiles rails against these intruders and the uncontrolled growth they bring to the rural West. Developers and tourists bear the brunt of his spleen, but he also has harsh words for those who long for the "good old days" while making a buck from the new, and for environmentalists who promote an "amenities economy" but fail to see how this commodifies nature. Though a curmudgeon, he allows some cautious optimism, advocating dialogue between the Old and the New West, and champions those who defy conventional economic wisdom. Even at his most acerbic&#x2014;castigating environmentalists and admonishing tourists to be humble&#x2014;Stiles never fails to be entertaining. 17 line drawings by the author. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The war is on!&#34; Eighteen-year-old Farley responded with glee, but four years later, pinned down in the wintry mud of Italy, he saw a soldier &#34;humping jerily away from his own leg, which had been severed at the thigh. In the instant I saw him, he gave one final bubbling shriek, collapsed and mercifully was still.&#34; And No Birds Sang is Mowat&#39;s gripping account of how a young man excited by the prospect of battle, is transformed into a war-weary veteran.Farley Mowat is one of the world&#39;s foremost nature writers and conservationists.

Since the end of the last war, he has tried to forget the atrocities he&#x2019;d witnessed. Most of all, he has tried to forget the horrors he inflicted on others as the deadliest assassin the French Army has ever known, unaware he will soon need the skills of war he once used to perfection.His youngest son, Jean-Pierre, lives the life of a typical thirteen-year-old. He attends school, helps his father in the fields, and tries not to be nervous around the mesmerizing Angelique Lapierre. Events will soon force him to become a man, and along with his father, brother, and a small group of citizens, they harass their German occupiers and help the Allies prepare for the D-Day invasion.

His genius was often likened to that of Mozart, Wagner, and Verdi, but in many of the world's opera houses his operas often receive an almost chilly respect, far removed from the nearly universal love aroused by those later masters. This book, the first layperson's guide to Monteverdi, seeks to stimulate appreciation for his operas by examining them not as musicological relics but as the vital theatrical experiences they are. Ringer places Monteverdi's operatic works within the musical and theatrical framework of his era, offering a brief sketch of the composer's early years and detailing the complex forces that led to the emergence of opera in late sixteenth-century Florence. <i>Opera's First Master</i> enables opera lovers to see and hear Monteverdi's masterpieces anew, while opening new channels of inquiry into how Monteverdean opera &#x201c;works&#x201d; in the theater.</p><p>MARK RINGER is associate professor of theater at Marymount Manhattan College.

He lives in New York City."...an uncommonly well-told accounting of Monteverdi&#x2019;s operatic legacy...

At stake was whether the world would be dominated by the forces of totalitarianism led by the Soviet Union, or inspired by the principles of economic and political freedom embodied in the United States. The Cold War established America as the leader of the free world and a global superpower. It shaped U.S. military strategy, economic policy, and domestic politics for nearly 50 years.<br><br>In <i>A Brief History of the Cold War</i>, distinguished scholars Lee Edwards and Elizabeth Edwards Spalding recount the pivotal events of this protracted struggle and explain the strategies that eventually led to victory for freedom. They analyze the development and implementation of containment, d�tente, and finally President Reagan's philosophy: "they lose, we win." The Cold War teaches important lessons about statecraft and America's indispensable role in the world.</p><p><br>The euphoria that accompanied the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union lasted only a moment, dashed by the horror of 9/11. But the rise of a new global enemy driven, like the old one, by a hatred of Western freedom and democracy makes the lessons of the Cold War as relevant as ever. <p></p>The half-century struggle between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, a struggle that determined whether hundreds of millions would live in freedom or slavery, is one of the most dramatic and consequential epochs in history. Yet to the generation that has grown up since the Cold War's astonishingly peaceful conclusion, this titanic geopolitical conflict can seem as remote as the Punic Wars. <p></p>In this accessible and highly readable account, Lee Edwards and Elizabeth Edwards Spalding explain the essential events, persons, and ideas that shaped the Cold War, from Harry Truman's strategy of containment to Richard Nixon's d�tente to Ronald Reagan's simple yet powerful philosophy of "we win, they lose." <p></p>When an American student can write, as one did recently to his local newspaper, that communism "is certainly not an ideology to be feared," even though it still oppresses more than a billion human beings from China to Cuba, the urgency of teaching this history to a new generation could not be clearer. <p></p>A nation that prizes its freedom must never forget the wisdom and courage with which the Cold War was waged and won.<br>LEE EDWARDS is a historian who has written extensively about the Cold War and U.S. foreign policy. He is the author of biographies of Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater, and William F. Buckley Jr. and editor of<i> The Collapse of Communism</i>, among many other books.

Here he swarms over the reader from each of these directions, describing in amusing-to-ribald fashion his experiences in labs and at seminars with famed scientists in San Francisco, Paris, Vienna, Trieste and elsewhere. His theme: that contemporary science, with its almost-daily discoveries and apparent marvels, seems firmly oriented toward the future, but underlying its key assumptions is a "system of belief" still tied to 19th century mechanistic determinism despite the innovations of Einstein, quantum mechanics, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and molecular biology. Berlinski's intellectual roller-coaster comes at last to the notion of randomness, and in brilliant but dizzying final chapters that discuss DNA, catastrophe theory, metric space and "life as a language-like system," he seems to arrive at a nonmystical vitalism that may well bring his peers to their feetcheering or protesting. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Han Solo Adventures (Classic Star Wars)</h2><p>Han Solo soars again--in this awesome trilogy of his extraordinary exploits.

He's one of those tenacious bulldogs who doesn't let go when he has a job to do. ("Bulldog" is appropriate, since he had previous service with the Marine Corps.) </i></p><p><i> When I started the initial selection process for SIX, Larry was at the top of my list. Why did I single out this lower-than-whale-shit E-4? Because he worked hard at everything he did. The average person will put some effort into the things that come naturally and slack off on the things they're no good at. Someone above average will work at improving their weak spots, but they might not push as hard in the areas that come easy, relying on their natural abilities. The exceptional person will go balls-to-the-wall, no matter what he's working on. Larry was exceptional. "Diligence" is one way to put it; "can-do" spirit is another. He was always hungry to learn more, willing to go that extra step to become a more qualified operator. </i></p><p><i> (Just to clarify things -- you'll hear a lot about both SIX and Red Cell, which are two related but distinct commands. SEAL Team SIX was charged with the mission of counterterrorism worldwide. That meant killing the terrorists or preventing them from doing their dirty deeds. Red Cell was designed to expose the Navy to terrorist tactics and help develop an antiterrorist environment throughout the Navy worldwide. That meant creating awareness and security programs that make it too hard for the nasties to get to you, so they'll give up and go down the street to the Air Farce base.) </i></p><p><i> There's another reason Larry impressed me. Most people's blood type is A, B, O, maybe AB; Larry's got something unique flowing through his veins -- type </i>L-O-Y-A-L-T-Y.<i> He's not just loyal to me; he's loyal to his beliefs. There's nothing half-assed with Larry -- it's all or nothing. (You'll soon see that this is a common attribute among the Real Team personalities. There's no "gray area" -- it's black or white. Compromise is not in their vocabulary.) An example of Larry's loyalty: after I selected him, he made sure I'd consider his swim buddy from training, Frank Phillips. (Frank is the other Gold Dust Twin.) Not only did he make sure I'd interview Frank, he also coached him -- told him to volunteer for the unit and not ask any dumb questions. Larry was loyal to his swim buddy, and to his new Team; he was a believer in the unit, even before the unit existed. </i></p><p><i> Another one of Larry's assets was his skill with foreign languages. He could develop a working knowledge of a language pretty damn fast; give him a few days, and he could understand and assess conversations and written material, and express himself pretty well -- with one drawback. Whatever language, he spoke it in a south Florida drawl. That limited his effectiveness in counterintelligence operations. No real problem there. We all have talents and limitations; the key is to maximize the former and limit the latter. I'd pick other guys in the Team for the verbal stuff. </i></p><p><i> But in every other way, Larry was terrific operationally. When he wants to, he can melt into the background and become wallpaper; he's got one of those faces that you feel like you know from somewhere. He mingles well with just about anybody; he can walk up to a total stranger and start a conversation without seeming pushy or threatening. </i></p><p><i> Behind that mild-mannered exterior, his brain is always going. He always has a purpose in mind; he's always collecting data, looking for ways to achieve the mission more effectively. He never stops learning, never stops passing on all he can. </i></p><p><i> Over the years, I had the privilege of watching Larry develop as a leader. He always led from the front and demanded top performance from his subordinates. He learned from the chiefs who raised him; he spent his time in the trenches with his troops, making sure they were well prepared, militarily and personally, for what they would face. He's a hell of an instructor -- meticulous in his presentation, eager to explain the "whys" that make it all work. He never forgets that this shit was new to him once, too. I've also had the pleasure of watching him raise his two young boys with the same thoroughness and dedication. He's determined to pass on everything his father gave to him, plus whatever his "sea daddies" shared with him. </i></p><p><i> I don't want this to sound like some kind of "I love you -- you love me" Valentine, so I've got to talk about Larry's flaws. His loyalty was so strong that his first impulse was to follow my orders or wishes, even if he saw a better way. He might not even tell me about that better way.

I thought it was...pretty interesting. We hit the radio station and received some fire, seized the radio station and basically stopped traffic. Not too long after that we started having guys arriving in these six-bys, armored trucks. That's when all hell broke loose. We had to shoot our way off the beach. Some of the guys had to swim out in the ocean and appropriate a fishing boat. </p><p> The first time, I guess, is always kind of strange. You're thinking, "Why are these guys shooting at me? I'm a pretty decent guy -- why are they trying to kill <i>me?</i> Just because I invaded their country..." But it was pretty wild. </p><p> Combat can be terrifying, exhilarating, powerful -- all these different things, depending on what's happening to you at the time and how well you deal with it all.

It all depends on what's happening on your little piece of ground. </p><p><br> My dad did a lot of different things. He was a shipbuilder -- built Liberty ships during World War II. He was one of thirteen children, and two of the boys served in the Army during the war. But he stayed at the shipyard. Then after the war, he did a lot of things. He trapped, sold hides, he opened a grocery store and filling station, he ran cattle -- think he had about 150 cattle at the most. He did whatever it took. </p><p> My mom pretty much ran that store. She did a whole lot of work herself. My father was probably the toughest man I ever met, but when it came down to it, my mother was tougher in the long run.

Came summer, he found you a job, farmed you out to people around here, maybe clearing land with a machete or working for a carpenter. So I had a job every summer.

They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him....<br><br>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, &#x201c;Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.&#x201d; So he went in to stay with them.<br><br>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, &#x201c;Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?&#x201d;<br><br>Imagine eavesdropping on the conversation between Jesus and these two disciples. Consider the questions they may have asked and the answers he gave. One day in Heaven, I want to see the video!<br><br>I&#x2019;ll bet at least one of their questions related to that which looms large for most who read this book: If God is good...why all this evil and suffering? If God loves us, how can he justify allowing (or sending) the sometimes overwhelming difficulties we face?<br><br>I invite you to join me on a journey to discover what God has to say about this subject. I can&#x2019;t think of a better way to do this than by daily meditating on his Word. I&#x2019;ve ended each meditation with a brief prayer, written from my heart. Perhaps my prayer will echo yours, or perhaps it will prompt for you a renewed conversation with God.<br><br>While exploring God&#x2019;s goodness in the midst of a suffering world, I&#x2019;ve taken the most pleasure in focusing on him, exploring his attributes of goodness, love, holiness, justice, patience, grace, and mercy. Although I haven&#x2019;t unearthed easy answers, I&#x2019;m astonished at how much insight the Bible offers.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve beheld a God who says, &#x201c;I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering&#x201d; (Exodus 3:7). I&#x2019;ve found great comfort in hearing God speak of a time when he could bear his people&#x2019;s misery no longer (see Judges 10:16). I revel in God&#x2019;s emphatic promise that he will make a New Earth, where he will come down to live with us and on which &#x201c;he will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain&#x201d; (Revelation 21:4).<br><br>Above all, in the process of meditating on this subject and writing this book, I&#x2019;ve seen Jesus.<br><br>The first physician to die of the AIDS virus in the United Kingdom was a young Christian. He contracted the disease while conducting medical research in Zimbabwe. In the last days of his life, he struggled to express himself to his wife. Near the end, he couldn&#x2019;t talk and had only enough strength to write the letter J. She ran through her mental dictionary, saying various words beginning with J. None was right. Finally she said, &#x201c;Jesus?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. Yes, Jesus.<br><br>Jesus filled his thoughts. That&#x2019;s all he wanted to say. That&#x2019;s all his wife needed to know.<br><br>In the end, that&#x2019;s all each of us needs to know.<br><br><i>Lord, I so look forward to having conversations with you where I not only ask questions but, like those disciples on the Emmaus road, also hear answers from your own mouth! I&#x2019;m grateful there&#x2019;s no need to envy the disciples, because one day I, too, will walk with you in a resurrected body, and you will open the Scriptures to me, and at last I will understand so much of what eludes me now. But until then, thank you that you are not silent! You&#x2019;ve provided your Word, your Holy Spirit, and your people to help me understand&#x2014;and grace to trust you when I don&#x2019;t.<br></i><br><b>1<br>Conflict with a Purpose</b><br><br>Then Joseph said to his brothers, &#x201c;Come close to me.&#x201d; When they had done so, he said, &#x201c;I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping. But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.<br><br>&#x201c;So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and<br>ruler of all Egypt....<br><br>&#x201c;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;Gene s i s 45 : 4 &#x2013; 8 ; 50 : 20<br><br>After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before. All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had&nbsp;known him before...comforted and consoled him over all the<br>trouble the Lord had brought upon him....<br><br>The Lord blessed the latter part of Job&#x2019;s life more than the first.<br><br>&#x2014;Job 4 2 : 10 &#x2013;12<br><br>While most of my books are nonfiction, I&#x2019;ve written seven full-length novels. Now, if I were to write a novel about lives without conflict, where characters get everything they want, where life marches on comfortably and no one ever loses anything, nobody would read it. Who likes a boring story? In fact, my central characters always face great conflict, turmoil, uncertainty, and suffering. Some die. That it makes for a far better story is my main reason for doing this. (We enjoy in fiction much that we do not enjoy in life.)<br><br>So who am I to say that God shouldn&#x2019;t write such things into his story, including my part?<br><br>In our lives God uses conflict not just to make the story better but to make us better. In life, not just literature, we repeatedly see that protection from conflict produces soft, spoiled, and selfish people, while enduring conflict is more likely to produce someone strong, capable, and caring.<br><br>If, in an interview with a character from one of my novels, you were to ask whether he&#x2019;d like to be written out of the story, he would answer no. Nonexistence appeals to no one. Now ask him if he would like to suffer less, and he&#x2019;ll answer yes. Who wouldn&#x2019;t?<br><br>I empathize with my characters since I, too, am a character in God&#x2019;s story. At times I&#x2019;d love to take a break from the drama. Three months off without stress would feel nice. But I also realize I&#x2019;m part of something great, far bigger than myself. And I trust God not only to bring the whole story together but also to do with my part of it what he knows to be best.<br><br>Given the option while facing his trials, I&#x2019;m confident Joseph would have walked off the stage of God&#x2019;s story. After betrayal by his brothers when he was a teenager and being sold into slavery and later falsely accused by Potiphar&#x2019;s wife and sent to prison, Joseph had surely endured enough for one life!<br><br>Talk to Job in the middle of his story&#x2014;with ten children dead and excruciating boils covering his body, God apparently abandoning him and friends haranguing him. Ask if he wants out. I know what he&#x2019;d say because he said it: &#x201c;Why did I not perish at birth?&#x201d; ( Job 3:11). But that&#x2019;s all over now. On the New Earth, sit by Job and Joseph at a lavish banquet with their Lord. Ask them, &#x201c;Be honest. Was it really worth it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; Job says. Joseph smiles, nodding emphatically.<br><br>&#x201c;But, Job, had God given you the choice, wouldn&#x2019;t you have walked out of the story?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a heartbeat. I&#x2019;m just glad he didn&#x2019;t let me.&#x201d;<br><br>You and I are characters in God&#x2019;s story, handmade by him. Every character serves a purpose. God loves a great story, and all of us who know him will recall and celebrate and continue to live in that story for all eternity.<br><br>Before we fault him for the plot twists we don&#x2019;t like, we should remember that Jesus has written this story in his own blood.<br><br><i>Father, what a privilege to be chosen by you to be a character in the greatest story ever told&#x2014;and to know that one day we&#x2019; ll be able to read it start to finish. Thank you for this true, unfolding drama of redemption. Thank you that in the ages to come we will praise you for not letting us walk off the pages.

Michael Lapsley, an Anglican priest and monastic from New Zealand, exiled to Zimbabwe because of his anti-apartheid work in South Africa, opened a package and was immediately struck by the blast of an explosion. The bomb suspected to be the work of the apartheid-era South African secret police blasted away both his hands and one of his eyes. His memoir tells the story of this horrendous event, backing up to recount the journey that led him there particularly his rising awareness of the radical social implications of the gospel and his identification with the liberation struggle and then the subsequent journey of the last two decades. Returning to South Africa, Lapsley saw a whole nation damaged by the apartheid era. So he discovered his new vocation to become a wounded healer, drawing on his own experience to promote the healing of other victims of violence and trauma. As he writes, My visible brokenness creates a bond with others whose brokenness is often less visible but just as real. The truth is that pain unites human beings. In my work as a healer, many people say they can trust me because I know pain. In the end, though, what matters most is whether we are able to transform pain into a life-giving force.</p><p>Michael Lapsley was born in New Zealand and ordained a priest in Australia after joining the Society of the Sacred Mission. The society sent him to South Africa as a missionary in 1973. There he became chaplain to Anglican university students and became active in the anti-apartheid movement, ultimately joining the African National Congress. Exiled to Zimbabwe, he narrowly survived an assassination attempt. Later, he returned to South Africa and participated in the transition to the post-apartheid era. In 1998 he founded the Institute for Healing of Memories, a project that has taken him around the world to work with victims--as well as perpetrators--of violence and trauma. Stephen Karakashian is an American psychotherapist who has spent a number of years working with Fr. Michael and the Institute in South Africa. He lives in Portland, OR.Although he was broken physically, he has become the most whole person I know, truly a wounded healer. --Archbishop Desmond Tutu<br><br>Michael s life represents a compelling metaphor . . . a foreigner who came to our country and was transformed. His life is part of the tapestry of the many long journeys and struggle of our people. --Nelson Mandela<br> --Nelson Mandela<br><br>Michael s life represents a compelling metaphor . . . a foreigner who came to our country and was transformed. His life is part of the tapestry of the many long journeys and struggle of our people. --Nelson Mandela<br><br>Not quite three months after Nelson Mandela was freed from Robben Island in 1990, Anglican priest and African National Congress chaplain Lapsley opened a letter sent in the mail. The bomb in it blew off both hands, sent shrapnel through his body, and destroyed one eye . . . . Though severely injured, his mind and tongue remain intact, producing this most amazing memoir of a man who writes he "has never made a distinction between human liberation and my Christian witness." . . . Within three years of his attack, he opened the doors of The Trauma Centre for Victims of Violence and Torture in Cape Town, in the new South Africa, and launched a global Healing of Memories program. The book's final section highlights stories from this work, from Rwanda to Northern Ireland, from Colombia to North Carolina. With dry, self-deprecating wit, Lapsley treats readers to an emotional, gripping tale of a priest, his prosthetics, and his promise, as St. Teresa of Avila put it, to be Christ's hands in the world. --Publishers' Weekly</p><h2>Eliot Ness: The Real Story</h2><p>This is the definitive biography of the famous crimefighter, Eliot Ness. <p>Behind the Hollywood legend portrayed by Robert Stack and Kevin Costner is a fascinating and highly effective lawman whose courage and cunning helped the federal government bring down Scarface Al Capone in gangland Chicago. </p><p>Ness went on to enjoy a successful law enforcement career in Cleveland, ridding the city of corrupt cops and organized crime figures. </p><p>You've heard the legend; now learn the REAL STORY.</p></p><p>Paul W.

Conceived as a sequel to that volume, <i>Surrealist Painters and Poets: An Anthology</i> does for Surrealism what Motherwell's book did for Dadaism. The concept and contents were discussed with Robert Motherwell and met with his enthusiastic approval.<br> <br> The essays, manifestos, poems, and texts in this anthology offer a composite picture of the Surrealists&#x2014;their convictions, styles, and spirit&#x2014;from the movement's beginnings in France just after World War I to its second flowering in America after World War II. The book includes writers and artists from Belgium, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Guyana, Italy, Martinique, Mauritius, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Senegal, Uruguay, and the United States. Caws's main criterion for inclusion was that the works be the best and most representative of the different forms of Surrealism. Among others, the artists and writers include Andre Breton, Marcel Duchamp and Rrose Selavy, Max Ernst, Mina Loy, Francis Picabia, and Tristan Tzara.</p><p>Mary Ann Caws is Distinguished Professor of English, French, and Comparative Literature in the Graduate School of the City University of New York and Co-director of its Henri Peyre French Institute. She is the author, editor, or translator of more than forty books in the fields of poetry and the avant-garde.While the lessons of surrealism have been pretty well assimilated by contemporary artists, the encyclopedic inclusivity of this selection, along with its global perspective and attention to women artists, provides plenty of surprises and new perspectives on this unconscious-driven movement. Renowned scholar and translator of French modernism Caws (The Eye of the Text, etc.), whose anthology Manifesto: A Century of Isms has just appeared (Forecasts, Feb. 19), makes her first, necessary act here to ignore what the rather dictatorial Andr&#x201a; Bretonfounder, primary theorist and tireless proselyte of the movementdeemed "surrealist" in his time, and to include work that is not just "automatic writing" or collaborative in nature, the two types of writing Breton championed most. Memoirs, poems, fables, manifestos, games and collaborative works, as well as photomontages, paintings, drawings and odd, scandalous objects, are included by artists well-known and not: Giorgio de Chirico, Man Ray, Philippe Soupault, Hans Bellmer, Kay Boyle, the founders of "negritude" Aim&#x201a; C&#x201a;saire and L&#x201a;opold S&#x201a;dar Senghor, Salvador Dal�, Duchamp, Frida Kahlo, Michel Leiris, the underrecognized painter Dorothea Tanning (wife of Max Ernst), Mina Loy, Antonin Artaud, Leonora Carrington and Joseph Cornell make their appearances among many others. Because it leans more toward the painterlyi.e., imagistic and spasmodically creativeside of the movement and less toward the exacting political and philosophical side, the book can seem unfocused, and the lack of scholarly material, such as chronologies or biographic introductions, may leave one in the dark about the minor figures and how they fit in. But Caws's goal (as with Manifesto) is to present an active constellation of work beyond the canonizing and historicizing of the academy, placing the work back in the lap of the creative reader, in the here and now of the culture today. On that level, this anthology succeeds richly. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>One Page Management: How to Use Information to Achieve Your Goals</h2><p>Presents a method of organizing data by means of a screening system that produces three one-page reports--Focus, Feedback, and Management--that identify and summarize key facts</p><p></p><h2>Puccini&#39;s Madame Butterfly</h2><p>A comprehensive guide to Puccini&#39;s MADAMA BUTTERFLY, featuring insightful and in depth Commentary and Analysis, and a complete, newly translated Libretto with Italian/English side-by side.</p><p>Other Opera Journeys Publishing titles ALSO AVAILABLE at amazon.com: <p>OPERA CLASSICS LIBRARY SERIES: <br>�Aida �The Barber of Seville �La Boh�me �Carmen �Cavalleria Rusticana �Cos� fan tutte �Don Giovanni �Lucia di Lammermoor �Madama Butterfly �The Magic Flute �Manon Lescaut �The Marriage of Figaro �Otello �I Pagliacci �Rigoletto �Salome �Tosca �Il Trittico (Il Tabarro/Suor Angelica/Gianni Schicchi) �La Traviata �Turandot and The Ring of the Nibelung (without libretto) </p><p>OPERA JOURNEYS MINI GUIDE SERIES: <br>�A�da �Andrea Ch�nier �The Barber of Seville �La Boh�me �Boris Godunov �Carmen �Cavalleria Rusticana �Cos� fan tutte �Der Freisch�tz �Die Fledermaus �Don Carlo �Don Giovanni �Don Pasquale �The Elixir of Love �Elektra �Eugene Onegin �Exploring Wagner&#x2019;s Ring �Falstaff �Faust �Fidelio �The Flying Dutchman �Hansel and Gretel �L&#x2019;Italiana in Algeri �Julius Caesar �Lohengrin �Lucia di Lammermoor �Macbeth �Madama Butterfly �The Magic Flute �Manon �Manon Lescaut �The Marriage of Figaro �A Masked Ball �The Mikado �Nabucco �Norma �Otello �I Pagliacci �Porgy and Bess �The Rhinegold �Rigoletto �Der Rosenkavalier �Salome �Samson and Delilah �Siegfried �The Tales of Hoffmann �Tannh�user �Tosca �La Traviata �Tristan and Isolde �Il Trovatore �Turandot �Twilight of the Gods �The Valkyrie �Werther </p><p>OPERA JOURNEYS LIBRETTO SERIES: <br>�Aida �The Barber of Seville �La Boh�me �Carmen �Cavalleria Rusticana �Cos� fan tutte �Don Giovanni �Edgar �La Fanciulla del West �Gianni Schicchi �Lucia di Lammermoor �Madama Butterfly �The Magic Flute �Manon Lescaut �The Marriage of Figaro �Otello �I Pagliacci �Rigoletto �La Rondine �Salome �Suor Angelica �Il Tabarro �Tosca �La Traviata �Le Villi </p><p>AND <br>A History of Opera: Milestones and Metamorphoses</p>Burton D.

And the college boys are playing basketball on TV. But on the streets of D.C., the homeboys are dealing, dissing, dying. From behind plate glass, with an 80s backbeat pounding in his brain, Marcus Clay watches it all happen, and prays that he can make a go with his downtown record store. Then a car comes careening down U Street. And what Marcus sees next will plunge him into the middle of a war.<br><br>A drug runner is decapitated in the crash. A bystander--a white boy desperate to buy a woman's love--snatches a bag of cash from the wreck. And a prince of crime wants it back. . . . For Marcus's buddy, Dimitri Karras, the mayhem is a chance to make a score. For a pair of dirty cops it's a chance to get free. And for dozens of lives swept up into the maelstrom, it's just another springtime in America's capital, where the game is played for keeps . . .</p><p>George P. Pelecanos's latest book is not only a tremendously detailed and emotionally powerful crime novel but also a virtual compendium and update of his other excellent novels that are all similarly rooted in the nonpolitical neighborhoods of Washington, D.C. Brought back for major roles are Marcus Clay, Dimitri Karras, and other important players from <i>King Suckerman</i>. There are poignant cameos by Randolph of <i>Shoedog</i> as well as the two Nick Stefanos--grandfather and grandson--from <i>The Big Blowdown</i>, <i>A Firing Offense</i>, <i>Down by the River Where the Dead Men Go</i>, and <i>Nick's Trip</i>. As always, Pelecanos uses jabs of pop music, basketball, clothes, and cars to quickly root us in time and place. <p> It's 1986, 10 years after the Bicentennial events of <i>King Suckerman</i>, so a woman in her 30s wears a Susanna Hoffs-style haircut "from the cover of the 'All Over the Place' album, not the redone look off the new LP." Dimitri, after a brief career as a teacher, is now working full-time for his friend Marcus's expanded chain of four Real Right record stores; he drives a BMW 325 and wears his graying hair moussed and spiked. (He also snorts more cocaine than Al Pacino did in <i>Scarface</i>, one of several films used as icons here.) The doomed basketball star Len Bias--just finishing his college career and about to sign a huge deal with the Boston Celtics--is on TV screens everywhere, admired equally by the former local hoops hero Clay and a conflicted cop named Kevin Murphy who has misplaced his moral compass. The complicated, satisfying plot involves $25,000 stolen from a drug dealer; several children in peril; smart adults who screw up their lives in dumb ways; and the speed with which violence festers and explodes in unexpected directions. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>"You can't put this book down or out of mind.

It was midafternoon, and Manchester bustled with business. He dodged carts and wagons and carriages all the way home. He remembered that when he was a young man he walked for pleasure, sending the carriage home early from the store. And then, when they had lost the house and moved into the rooms over the store, he had walked not at all, if he could help it. He was irritated by business, ashamed of the sweat of his brow. Sweat was for less sensitive men, the near-animals who made their nails and wove their endless cloth and tended their machinery in the factories that pumped the air out of the sky and replaced it with foul coal smoke.<br>This was not the first day John had left early. Many times, pushing another man&#x2019;s broom in another man&#x2019;s store, he had become impatient and taken his box of paints and pens and coals, and a sheaf of papers, and headed out of the city, beyond Broughton to the north or Ardwick to the east, to where the scenes were rustic and unspoiled, to where the carriages did not come.<br>There was no grace in carriages, or in any of the works of men, John was sure. To him all buildings were blocky protuberances from the surface of the earth; Manchester was a vast blemish. He could not paint with a carriage in the scene; the thought of drawing a shop or factory would never have occurred to him. Instead he had always painted the gentle, wild scenes by the River Medlock, upstream of Manchester where the water was drinkable and fish had strength to leap.<br>But now he had painted everything within a day&#x2019;s going and coming of Manchester. Even if he had not, he had no will to paint anything near this city, even if he saw something new. Tied to the shop by his need for money, where the work dulled him and slowed his mind and heart, he could not paint his best. True, the painters in London were forced to paint portraits, dull visions of dull people, in order to finance themselves in style. But at least they painted for their bread and were received as artists in society, not forced to bear the crude manners of factory men, not forced to smile and deferently give them what they wanted for their coins, their precious and grudgingly given pennies and shillings. A real painter never had fingers so stiff from gripping a broom that he could not hold a brush.<br>So today John left work early, but did not go to the countryside. Instead he headed home.<br>Home was surely not where he had intended to go. He had meant to go east, keep walking until he reached London, where a discriminating audience would soon recognize his talent. But, as always, his feet would not let him leave Anna, not without seeing her one last time. He tried to remember--hadn&#x2019;t he felt this way before? Hadn&#x2019;t he meant to leave, and then changed his mind because of Anna&#x2019;s comfortable ways?<br>Busy people passed him, hurrying, shoving sometimes, jostling and scrambling for place in the dirty streets. John refused to let his heart beat as quickly as theirs. His footsteps were slower. More relaxed. He could hear the silent criticisms as the busy men went by. Idler. Slacker. If you have no hurry, don&#x2019;t take place on the road. But I am not on the road, John answered. I am walking in the meadow God meant this place to be. You have hidden it in stone, but still my feet can feel the grass, my ears can hear the bees dozing on the dandelions.<br>Home was one apartment in a long building that stretched the length of a block of Bedford Street. It was a nice enough place, their cottage, but definitely middle class. Definitely middle-bordering-on-lower class. Not the home of a gentleman. I was meant to be a gentleman, John Kirkham thought bitterly. If the universe were properly run I would manage a great estate and paint in the garden in the afternoon. God is perfect when it comes to nature, but he&#x2019;s far too whimsical with the lives of men. Bees don&#x2019;t dig badger holes, yet I take small money and wait on barbarians. I have been mislaid in a world of brick. If my father had had the good sense to be as impotent as he was stupid, I might have had my soul placed in a different family, with the right advantages. The stone walls of the great houses in the countryside. Some men should not have had children.<br>&#x201c;Father.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dinah. Your cheek is dirty. Your mother ought to wash you more.&#x201d;<br>His ten-year-old daughter looked up at him with her inscrutable face. She neither smiled nor frowned nor anything at all. Like a cat, her eyes just stared into his face, as if she knew what lay behind his eyes. He felt a rush of guilt, knowing that he had decided to leave. Damn this girl for her silence, for her seeing eyes.<br>&#x201c;Enough of that,&#x201c; he said to her. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s for supper?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t ready yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course it isn&#x2019;t, girl; I&#x2019;m home early, do you think I don&#x2019;t know that?&#x201d; He was ashamed to be annoyed, yet could not curb either the annoyance or the shame. &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you in school?&#x201d;<br>She said nothing, only looked at him. Of course he remembered why. The girls were sent home earlier than the boys. But she could make a civil answer, couldn&#x2019;t she? He wanted to shake her. Answer me, damn you. What are you thinking? Speak, child, or I&#x2019;ll know the devil&#x2019;s in you. But he knew from experience that nothing would get words from this child unless she felt the need to speak. Her school uniform was frayed, faded, and too small. Not my fault. It was my father who gambled it all away. It&#x2019;s not my fault for my father&#x2019;s sins.<br>He brushed past his lithe daughter and entered the cottage. Onions were strong in the air. That meant no meat tonight, so there were onions to give some flavor to the potatoes. The endless potatoes, poor man&#x2019;s food. Filthy Papist Irishman&#x2019;s food. John resented the potatoes without letting himself draw a connection between the low wages he brought home and the hours he spent away from the shop to play with a paintbrush that earned no money.<br>&#x201c;Anna,&#x201c; he said. Anna was surprised to see him home. Well, be surprised if you like, Anna. Life is rude shocks, Anna, and the rudest of all is the shock of learning where you must live your life, and that you may never leave that place. But I will leave.<br>&#x201c;Are you ill, to be home early?&#x201d;<br>He shook his head. &#x201c;Only tired.&#x201d;<br>He ignored the frown on Anna&#x2019;s forehead. Only tired. His own words were an accusation: she was also tired, but where could <em>she</em>go to escape from her work?<br>Charlie came down the stairs, a book under his arm. He was small for seven years old, but bright and eager. Was I bright and eager at seven? John did not think so. He had been a moody child, had grown to be a melancholy man. Brightness was Anna&#x2019;s manner, and Charlie was Anna&#x2019;s boy. &#x201c;Papa, are you ill?&#x201d;<br>Again no. &#x201c;I just couldn&#x2019;t bear the shop any longer, and old Martin couldn&#x2019;t bear me, and so we agreed to part company.&#x201d; He saw Anna&#x2019;s eyes go wide with fear. &#x201c;Only for the afternoon, Anna. I haven&#x2019;t lost my place.&#x201d; He spoke snidely, angrily; how dare she care about his <em>place</em>when she didn&#x2019;t give a damn about his soul. Fine with <em>you</em>if your husband never achieves what he was born to do, just so he brings home money. Never mind how the earning of it ruins him.<br>She clattered the spoons on the table; she was angry that he had spoken so sharply to her. It was unfair, and he was sorry. &#x201c;You should have been the man, Anna,&#x201c; he said mildly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be rich by now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;d look fine in a fancy gown, John,&#x201c; she said, smiling at him. Again he felt contempt for her, for being so changeable of mood. When <em>he</em>was sad, he stayed quite glum all day; another sign of the weakness of women, that they could not hold a humour.<br>Charlie came to his mother and began reciting. The sound of it throbbed in John&#x2019;s head; he would have left, but his languor sank him deep into the chair and he could not move.<br>* * *<br><em>Know then thyself, presume not God to scan</em>;<br><em>The proper study of mankind is man</em>.<br>* * *<br>Wretched boy. Miserable boy. Your mother&#x2019;s son to the core. Read read read. Recite it once, recite it twice until all the family can say the words along with you. And the boy&#x2019;s worst habit was to get well into a piece he had done a hundred times and then stop, leaving the last few lines to hammer endlessly through his father&#x2019;s head.<br>&#x201c;Born but to die, and reasoning but to err.&#x201d;<br>What sort of miserable stuff is Anna teaching to the boy? Born but to die. Sounds downright Papist. Anna <em>will</em>have the children read, <em>will</em>have them go to school, whatever it costs, however it means that he must do his endless, meaningless toil and be content eating potatoes and onions, so the children can have their books. It&#x2019;s not as if the boy <em>understood</em>any of what he spouted. Ta-DUM ta-DUM ta-DUM ta DUM ta-DUM.<br>* * *<br><em>Created half to rise and half to fall</em>;<br><em>Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all</em>;<br><em>Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled</em>:<br><em>The glory, jest, and riddle of the world</em>.<br>* * *<br>Just as John was about to cry aloud, about to run from the house begging for silence, for respite from the boy&#x2019;s rote wisdom, just then came Dinah&#x2019;s gentle hand on his forehead, stroking, calming. He did not open his eyes and look at her; did not speak to her, because she would not answer. He just slumped in his chair and let her gentle hands minister to his inward pain. His younger son might be unbearable, but his daughter had a good heart and a knack for kindness. Of course I won&#x2019;t go.<br>H...</p></p><h2>Days of Our Lives: The Complete Family Album: A 30th Anniversary Celebration</h2><p>Published to coincide with the popular soap opera&#39;s thirtieth anniversary and including commentary by Diedre Hall, a fan&#39;s album provides two hundred color photographs and covers the top moments in the show&#39;s history. 175,000 first printing. $35,000 ad/promo.</p><p>For three decades, Salem has been a second home to millions of devotees of <i>Days of Our Lives</i>, one of the most popular daytime dramas ever aired on television.

He and the little girl were holding hands and walking up Third Avenue in New York City, walking fast, almost running. He looked back over his shoulder and the green car was still there, crawling along slowly in the curbside lane.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, Daddy. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at her and saw how pale her face was. There were dark circles under her eyes. He picked her up and sat her in the crook of his arm, but he didn&#x2019;t know how long he could go on like that. He was tired, too, and Charlie was no lightweight anymore.<br> <br>It was five-thirty in the afternoon and Third Avenue was clogged. They were crossing streets in the upper Sixties now, and these cross streets were both darker and less populated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But that was what he was afraid of.<br> <br>They bumped into a lady pushing a walker full of groceries. &#x201c;Look where you&#x2019;re goin, whyn&#x2019;t ya?&#x201d; she said, and was gone, swallowed in the hurrying crowds.<br> <br>His arm was getting tired, and he switched Charlie to the other one. He snatched another look behind, and the green car was still there, still pacing them, about half a block behind. There were two men in the front seat and, he thought, a third in the back.<br> <br>What do I do now?<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t know the answer to that. He was tired and scared and it was hard to think. They had caught him at a bad time, and the bastards probably knew it. What he wanted to do was just sit down on the dirty curbing and cry out his frustration and fear. But that was no answer. He was the grownup. He would have to think for both of them.<br> <br>What do we do now?<br> <br>No money. That was maybe the biggest problem, after the fact of the men in the green car. You couldn&#x2019;t do anything with no money in New York. People with no money disappeared in New York; they dropped into the sidewalks, never to be seen again.<br> <br>He looked back over his shoulder, saw the green car was a little closer, and the sweat began to run down his back and his arms a little faster. If they knew as much as he suspected they did&#x2014;if they knew how little of the push he actually had left&#x2014;they might try to take him right here and now. Never mind all the people, either. In New York, if it&#x2019;s not happening to you, you develop this funny blindness. Have they been charting me? Andy wondered desperately. If they have, they know, and it&#x2019;s all over but the shouting. If they had, they knew the pattern. After Andy got some money, the strange things stopped happening for a while. The things they were interested in.<br> <br>Keep walking.<br> <br>Sho, boss. Yassuh, boss. Where?<br> <br>He had gone into the bank at noon because his radar had been alerted&#x2014;that funny hunch that they were getting close again. There was money in the bank, and he and Charlie could run on it if they had to. And wasn&#x2019;t that funny? Andrew McGee no longer had an account at the Chemical Allied Bank of New York, not personal checking, not business checking, not savings. They had all disappeared into thin air, and that was when he knew they really meant to bring the hammer down this time. Had all of that really been only five and a half hours ago?<br> <br>But maybe there was a tickle left. Just one little tickle. It had been nearly a week since the last time&#x2014;that presuicidal man at Confidence Associates who had come to the regular Thursday-night counseling session and then begun to talk with an eerie calmness about how Hemingway had committed suicide. And on the way out, his arm casually around the presuicidal man&#x2019;s shoulders, Andy had given him a push. Now, bitterly, he hoped it had been worth it. Because it looked very much as if he and Charlie were going to be the ones to pay. He almost hoped an echo&#x2014;<br> <br>But no. He pushed that away, horrified and disgusted with himself. That was nothing to wish on anybody.<br> <br>One little tickle, he prayed. That&#x2019;s all, God, just one little tickle. Enough to get me and Charlie out of this jam.<br> <br>And oh God, how you&#x2019;ll pay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. plus the fact that you&#x2019;ll be dead for a month afterward, just like a radio with a blown tube. Maybe six weeks. Or maybe really dead, with your worthless brains leaking out your ears. What would happen to Charlie then?<br> <br>They were coming up on Seventieth Street and the light was against them. Traffic was pouring across and pedestrians were building up at the corner in a bottleneck. And suddenly he knew this was where the men in the green car would take them. Alive if they could, of course, but if it looked like trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, they had probably been briefed on Charlie, too.<br> <br>Maybe they don&#x2019;t even want us alive anymore. Maybe they&#x2019;ve decided just to maintain the status quo. What do you do with a faulty equation? Erase it from the board.<br> <br>A knife in the back, a silenced pistol, quite possibly something more arcane&#x2014;a drop of rare poison on the end of a needle. Convulsions at the corner of Third and Seventieth. Officer, this man appears to have suffered a heart attack.<br> <br>He would have to try for that tickle. There was just nothing else.<br> <br>They reached the waiting pedestrians at the corner. Across the way, DON&#x2019;T WALK held steady and seemingly eternal. He looked back. The green car had stopped. The curbside doors opened and two men in business suits got out. They were young and smooth-cheeked. They looked considerably fresher than Andy McGee felt.<br> <br>He began elbowing his way through the clog of pedestrians, eyes searching frantically for a vacant cab.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, man&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For Christ&#x2019; sake, fella!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, mister, you&#x2019;re stepping on my dog&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. excuse me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Andy said desperately. He searched for a cab. There were none. At any other time the street would have been stuffed with them. He could feel the men from the green car coming for them, wanting to lay hands on him and Charlie, to take them with them God knew where, the Shop, some damn place, or do something even worse&#x2014;<br> <br>Charlie laid her head on his shoulder and yawned.<br> <br>Andy saw a vacant cab.<br> <br>&#x201c;Taxi! Taxi!&#x201d; he yelled, flagging madly with his free hand.<br> <br>Behind him, the two men dropped all pretense and ran.<br> <br>The taxi pulled over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold it!&#x201d; one of the men yelled. &#x201c;Police! Police!&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman near the back of the crowd at the corner screamed, and then they all began to scatter.<br> <br>Andy opened the cab&#x2019;s back door and handed Charlie in. He dived in after her. &#x201c;La Guardia, step on it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold it, cabby. Police!&#x201d;<br> <br>The cab driver turned his head toward the voice and Andy pushed&#x2014;very gently. A dagger of pain was planted squarely in the center of Andy&#x2019;s forehead and then quickly withdrawn, leaving a vague locus of pain, like a morning headache&#x2014;the kind you get from sleeping on your neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re after that black guy in the checkered cap, I think,&#x201d; he said to the cabby.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; the driver said, and pulled serenely away from the curb. They moved down East Seventieth.<br> <br>Andy looked back. The two men were standing alone at the curb. The rest of the pedestrians wanted nothing to do with them. One of the men took a walkie-talkie from his belt and began to speak into it. Then they were gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;That black guy,&#x201d; the driver said, &#x201c;whadde do? Rob a liquor store or somethin, you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Andy said, trying to think how to go on with this, how to get the most out of this cab driver for the least push. Had they got the cab&#x2019;s plate number? He would have to assume they had. But they wouldn&#x2019;t want to go to the city or state cops, and they would be surprised and scrambling, for a while at least<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all a bunch of junkies, the blacks in this city,&#x201d; the driver said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me, I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlie was going to sleep. Andy took off his corduroy jacket, folded it, and slipped it under her head. He had begun to feel a thin hope. If he could play this right, it might work. Lady Luck had sent him what Andy thought of (with no prejudice at all) as a pushover. He was the sort that seemed the easiest to push, right down the line: he was white (Orientals were the toughest, for some reason); he was quite young (old people were nearly impossible) and of medium intelligence (bright people were the easiest pushes, stupid ones harder, and with the mentally retarded it was impossible).<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve changed my mind,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;Take us to Albany, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; The driver stared at him in the rearview mirror. &#x201c;Man, I can&#x2019;t take a fare to Albany, you out of your mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>Andy pulled his wallet, which contained a single dollar bill. He thanked God that this was not one of those cabs with a bulletproof partition and no way to contact the driver except through a money slot. Open contact always made it easier to push. He had been unable to figure out if that was a psychological thing or not, and right now it was immaterial.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give you a five-hundred-dollar bill,&#x201d; Andy said quietly, &#x201c;to take me and my daughter to Albany. Okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeee-sus, mister&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Andy stuck the bill into the cabby&#x2019;s hand, and as the cabby looked down at it, Andy pushed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and pushed hard. For a terrible second he was afraid it wasn&#x2019;t going to work, that there was simply nothing left, that he had scraped the bottom of the barrel when he had made the driver see the nonexistent black man in the checkered cab.<br> <br>Then the feeling came&#x2014;as always accompanied by that steel dagger of pain. At the same moment, his stomach seemed to take on weight and his bowels locked in sick, gripping agony. He put an unsteady hand to his face and wondered if he was going to throw up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or die. For that one moment he wanted to die, as he always did when he overused it&#x2014;use it, don&#x2019;t abuse it, the sign-off slogan of some long-ago disc jockey echoing sickly in his mind&#x2014;whatever &#x201c;it&#x201d; was. If at that very moment someone had slipped a gun into his hand&#x2014;<br> <br>Then he looked sideways at Charlie, Charlie sleeping, Charlie trusting him to get them out of this mess as he had all the others, Charlie confident he would be there when she woke up. Yes, all the messes, except it was all the same mess, the same fucking mess, and all they were doing was running again. Black despair pressed behind his eyes.<br> <br>The feeling passed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not the headache. The headache would get worse and worse until it was a smashing weight, sending red pain through his head and neck with every pulsebeat. Bright lights would make his eyes water helplessly and send darts of agony into the flesh just behind his eyes. His sinuses would close and he would have to breathe through his mouth. Drill bits in his temples. Small noises magnified, ordinary noises as loud as jackhammers, loud noises insupportable. The headache would worsen until it felt as if his head were being crushed inside an inquisitor&#x2019;s lovecap. Then it would even off at that level for six hours, or eight, or maybe ten. This time he didn&#x2019;t know. He had never pushed it so far when he was so close to drained. For whatever length of time he was in the grip of the headache, he would be next to helpless. Charlie would have to take care of him. God knew she had done it before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but they had been lucky. How many times could you be lucky?<br> <br>&#x201c;Gee, mister, I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Which meant he thought it was law trouble.<br> <br>&#x201c;The deal only goes as long as you don&#x2019;t mention it to my little girl,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;The last two weeks she&#x2019;s been with me. Has to be back with her mother tomorrow morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Visitation rights,&#x201d; the cabby said. &#x201c;I know all about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You see, I was supposed to fly her up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To Albany? Probably Ozark, am I right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Now, the thing is, I&#x2019;m scared to death of flying. I know how crazy that sounds, but it&#x2019;s true. Usually I drive her back up, but this time my ex-wife started in on me, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; In truth, Andy didn&#x2019;t. He had made up the story on the spur of the moment and now it seemed to be headed straight down a blind alley. Most of it was pure exhaustion.<br> <br>&#x201c;So I drop you at the old Albany airport, and as far as Moms knows, you flew, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; His head was thudding.<br> <br>&#x201c;Also, so far as Moms knows, you&#x2019;re no plucka-plucka-plucka, am I four oh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Plucka-plucka-plucka? What was that supposed to mean? The pain was getting bad.<br> <br>&#x201c;Five hundred bucks to skip a plane ride,&#x201d; the driver mused.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s worth it to me,&#x201d; Andy said, and gave one last little shove. In a very quiet voice, speaking almost into the cabby&#x2019;s ear, he added, &#x201c;And it ought to be worth it to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; the driver said in a dreamy voice. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t turning down no five hundred dollars. Don&#x2019;t tell me, I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Andy said, and settled back. The cab driver was satisfied. He wasn&#x2019;t wondering about Andy&#x2019;s half-baked story. He wasn&#x2019;t wondering what a seven-year-old girl was doing visiting her father for two weeks in October with school in. He wasn&#x2019;t wondering about the fact that neither of them had so much as an overnight bag. He wasn&#x2019;t worried about anything. He had been pushed.<br> <br>Now Andy would go ahead and pay the price.<br> <br>He put a hand on Charlie&#x2019;s leg. She was fast asleep. They had been on the go all afternoon&#x2014;ever since Andy got to her school and pulled her out of her second-grade class with some half-remembered excuse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. grandmother&#x2019;s very ill&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. called home&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sorry to have to take her in the middle of the day. And beneath all that a great, swelling relief. How he had dreaded looking into Mrs. Mishkin&#x2019;s room and seeing Charlie&#x2019;s seat empty, her books stacked neatly inside her desk: No, Mr. McGee&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she went with your friends about two hours ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they had a note from you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wasn&#x2019;t that all right? Memories of Vicky coming back, the sudden terror of the empty house that day. His crazy chase after Charlie. Because they had had her once before, oh yes.<br> <br>But Charlie had been there. How close had it been? Had he beaten them by half an hour? Fifteen minutes? Less? He didn&#x2019;t like to think about it. He had got them a late lunch at Nathan&#x2019;s and they had spent the rest of the afternoon just going&#x2014;Andy could admit to himself now that he had been in a state of blind panic&#x2014;riding subways, buses, but mostly just walking. And now she was worn out.<br> <br>He spared her a long, loving look. Her hair was shoulder length, perfect blond, and in her sleep she had a calm beauty. She looked so much like Vicky that it hurt. He closed his own eyes.<br> <br>In the front seat, the cab driver looked wonderingly at the five-hundred-dollar bill the guy had handed him. He tucked it away in the special belt pocket where he kept all of his tips. He didn&#x2019;t think it was strange that this fellow in the back had been walking around New York with a little girl and a five-hundred-dollar bill in his pocket.

We have a home movie taken when I was two years old, the old-fashioned kind with no sound track, and by now the colors have bled out&#x2014;a white sky, my red sneakers a ghostly pink&#x2014;but you can still see how much I used to talk.</p><p>I&#x2019;m doing a bit of landscaping, picking up one stone at a time from our gravel driveway, carrying it to a large tin washtub, dropping it in, and going back for the next. I&#x2019;m working hard, but showily. I widen my eyes like a silent film star. I hold up a clear piece of quartz to be admired, put it in my mouth, stuff it into one cheek.</p><p>My mother appears and removes it. She steps back then, out of the frame, but I&#x2019;m speaking emphatically now&#x2014;you can see this in my gestures&#x2014;and she returns, drops the stone into the tub. The whole thing lasts about five minutes and I never stop talking.</p><p>A few years later, Mom read us that old fairy tale in which one sister (the older) speaks in toads and snakes and the other (the younger) in flowers and jewels, and this is the image it conjured for me, this scene from this movie, where my mother puts her hand into my mouth and pulls out a diamond.</p><p>I was towheaded back then, prettier as a child than I&#x2019;ve turned out, and dolled up for the camera. My flyaway bangs are pasted down with water and held on one side by a rhinestone barrette shaped like a bow. Whenever I turn my head, the barrette blinks in the sunlight. My little hand sweeps over my tub of rocks. All this, I could be saying, all this will be yours someday.</p><p>Or something else entirely. The point of the movie isn&#x2019;t the words themselves. What my parents valued was their extravagant abundance, their inexhaustible flow.</p><p>Still, there were occasions on which I had to be stopped. When you think of two things to say, pick your favorite and only say that, my mother suggested once, as a tip to polite social behavior, and the rule was later modified to one in three. My father would come to my bedroom door each night to wish me happy dreams and I would speak without taking a breath, trying desperately to keep him in my room with only my voice. I would see his hand on the doorknob, the door beginning to swing shut. I have something to say! I&#x2019;d tell him, and the door would stop midway.</p><p>Start in the middle then, he&#x2019;d answer, a shadow with the hall light behind him, and tired in the evenings the way grown-ups are. The light would reflect in my bedroom window like a star you could wish on.</p><p>Skip the beginning. Start in the middle.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Part One</p><p>The storm which blew me out of my past eased off.</p><p>&#x2014;FRANZ KAFKA, &#x201c;A Report for an Academy&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>One</p><p>SO THE MIDDLE of my story comes in the winter of 1996. By then, we&#x2019;d long since dwindled to the family that old home movie foreshadowed&#x2014;me, my mother, and, unseen but evident behind the camera, my father. In 1996, ten years had passed since I&#x2019;d last seen my brother, seventeen since my sister disappeared. The middle of my story is all about their absence, though if I hadn&#x2019;t told you that, you might not have known. By 1996, whole days went by in which I hardly thought of either one.</p><p>1996. Leap year. Year of the Fire Rat. President Clinton had just been reelected; this would all end in tears. Kabul had fallen to the Taliban. The Siege of Sarajevo had ended. Charles had recently divorced Diana.</p><p>Hale-Bopp came swinging into our sky. Claims of a Saturn-like object in the comet&#x2019;s wake first surfaced that November. Dolly, the cloned sheep, and Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer program, were superstars. There was evidence of life on Mars. The Saturn-like object in Hale-Bopp&#x2019;s tail was maybe an alien spaceship. In May of &#x2019;97, thirty-nine people would kill themselves as a prerequisite to climbing aboard.</p><p>Against this backdrop, how ordinary I look. In 1996, I was twenty-two years old, meandering through my fifth year at the University of California, Davis, and still maybe only a junior or maybe a senior, but so thoroughly uninterested in the niceties of units or requirements or degrees that I wouldn&#x2019;t be graduating anytime soon. My education, my father liked to point out, was wider than it was deep. He said this often.</p><p>But I saw no reason to hurry. I&#x2019;d no particular ambitions beyond being either widely admired or stealthily influential&#x2014;I was torn between the two. It hardly mattered, as no major seemed to lead reliably to either.</p><p>My parents, who were still paying my expenses, found me aggravating. My mother was often aggravated those days. It was something new for her, analeptic doses of righteous aggravation. She was rejuvenated by it. She&#x2019;d recently announced that she was through being a translator and go-between for me and my father; he and I had hardly spoken since. I don&#x2019;t remember minding. My father was himself a college professor and a pedant to the bone. Every exchange contained a lesson, like the pit in a cherry. To this day, the Socratic method makes me want to bite someone.</p><p>Autumn came suddenly that year, like a door opening. One morning I was bicycling to class when a large flock of Canada geese passed overhead. I couldn&#x2019;t see them, or much of anything else, but I heard the jazzy honking above me. There was a tule fog off the fields and I was wrapped inside it, pedaling through clouds. Tule fogs are not like other fogs, not spotty or drifting, but fixed and substantial. Probably anyone would have felt the risk of moving quickly through an unseen world, but I have&#x2014;or had as a child&#x2014;a particular penchant for slapstick and mishap, so I took the full thrill from it.</p><p>I felt polished by the wet air and maybe just a little migratory myself, just a little wild. This meant I might flirt a bit in the library if I sat next to anyone flirtable or I might daydream in class. I often felt wild back then; I enjoyed the feeling, but nothing had ever come of it.</p><p>At lunchtime I grabbed something, probably grilled cheese, let&#x2019;s say it was grilled cheese, in the school cafeteria. I was in the habit of leaving my books on the chair next to me, where they could be quickly moved if someone interesting came by but would discourage the uninteresting. At twenty-two, I had the callowest possible definition of interesting and, by the measure of my own calipers, was far from interesting myself.</p><p>A couple was sitting at a table near me and the girl&#x2019;s voice gradually rose to the point where I was forced to pay attention. &#x201c;You want some fucking space?&#x201d; she said. She was wearing a short blue T-shirt and a necklace with a glass pendant of an angelfish. Long, dark hair fell in a messy braid down her back. She stood and cleared the table with one motion of her arm. She had beautiful biceps; I remember wishing I had arms like hers.</p><p>Dishes fell to the floor and shattered; catsup and cola spilled and mixed in the breakage. There must have been music in the background, because there&#x2019;s always music in the background now, our whole lives sound-tracked (and most of it too ironic to be random. I&#x2019;m just saying), but honestly I don&#x2019;t remember. Maybe there was only a sweet silence and the spit of grease on the grill.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; the girl asked. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me to be quiet. I&#x2019;m just making more space for you.&#x201d; She pushed the table itself over, swung it to one side, dropped it. &#x201c;Better?&#x201d; She raised her voice. &#x201c;Can everyone please leave the room so my boyfriend has more space? He needs a fucking lot of space.&#x201d; She slammed her chair down onto the pile of catsup and dishes. More sounds of breakage and a sudden waft of coffee.</p><p>The rest of us were frozen&#x2014;forks halfway to our mouths, spoons dipped in our soups, the way people were found after the eruption of Vesuvius.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this, baby,&#x201d; her boyfriend said once, but she was doing it and he didn&#x2019;t bother to repeat himself. She moved to another table, empty except for a tray with dirty dishes. There, she methodically broke everything that could be broken, threw everything that could be thrown. A saltshaker spun across the floor to my foot.</p><p>A young man rose from his seat, telling her, with a slight stutter, to take a chill pill. She threw a spoon that bounced audibly off his forehead. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t side with assholes,&#x201d; she said. Her voice was very not chill.</p><p>He sank back, eyes wide. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; he assured the room at large, but he sounded unconvinced. And then surprised. &#x201c;Holy shit! I&#x2019;ve been assaulted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is just the shit I can&#x2019;t take,&#x201d; the boyfriend said. He was a big guy, with a thin face, loose jeans, and a long coat. Nose like a knife. &#x201c;You go ahead and tear it up, you psycho bitch. Just give me back the key to my place first.&#x201d;</p><p>She swung another chair, missing my head by maybe four feet&#x2014;I&#x2019;m being charitable; it seemed like a lot less&#x2014;striking my table and upsetting it. I grabbed my glass and plate. My books hit the floor with a loud slap. &#x201c;Come and get it,&#x201d; she told him.</p><p>It struck me funny, a cook&#x2019;s invitation over a pile of broken plates, and I laughed once, convulsively, a strange duck-like hoot that made everyone turn. And then I stopped laughing, because it was no laughing matter, and everyone turned back. Through the glass walls I could see some people on the quad who&#x2019;d noticed the commotion and were watching. A threesome on their way in for lunch stopped short at the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He took a few steps in her direction. She scooped up a handful of catsup-stained sugar cubes and threw them.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m finished,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished. I&#x2019;m putting your shit in the hallway and I&#x2019;m changing the locks.&#x201d; He turned and she threw a glass, which bounced off his ear. He missed a step, staggered, touched the spot with one hand, checked his fingers for blood. &#x201c;You owe me for gas,&#x201d; he said without looking back. &#x201c;Mail it.&#x201d; And he was gone.</p><p>There was a moment&#x2019;s pause as the door closed. Then the girl turned on the rest of us. &#x201c;What are you losers looking at?&#x201d; She picked up one of the chairs and I couldn&#x2019;t tell if she was going to put it back or throw it. I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d decided.</p><p>A campus policeman arrived. He approached me cautiously, hand on his holster. Me! Standing above my toppled table and chair, still holding my harmless glass of milk and my plate with the harmless half-eaten grilled cheese sandwich. &#x201c;Just put it down, honey,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and sit for a minute.&#x201d; Put it down where? Sit where? Nothing in my vicinity was upright but me. &#x201c;We can talk about this. You can tell me what&#x2019;s going on. You&#x2019;re not in any trouble yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not her,&#x201d; the woman behind the counter told him. She was a large woman, and old&#x2014;forty or more&#x2014;with a beauty mark on her upper lip and eyeliner collecting in the corners of her eyes. You all act like you own the place, she&#x2019;d said to me once, on another occasion, when I sent back a burger for more cooking. But you just come and go. You don&#x2019;t even think how I&#x2019;m the one who stays.</p><p>&#x201c;The tall one,&#x201d; she told the cop. She pointed, but he was paying no attention, so intent on me and whatever my next move would be.</p><p>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; he said again, soft and friendly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not in any trouble yet.&#x201d; He stepped forward, passing right by the girl with the braid and the chair. I saw her eyes behind his shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Never a policeman when you need one,&#x201d; she said to me. She smiled and it was a nice smile. Big white teeth. &#x201c;No rest for the wicked.&#x201d; She hoisted the chair over her head. &#x201c;No soup for you.&#x201d; She launched it away from me and the cop, toward the door. It landed on its back.</p><p>When the policeman turned to look, I dropped my plate and my fork. I honestly didn&#x2019;t mean to. The fingers of my left hand just unclenched all of a sudden. The noise spun the cop back to me.</p><p>I was still holding my glass, half full of milk. I raised it a little, as if proposing a toast. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; he said, a whole lot less friendly now. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not playing around here. Don&#x2019;t you fucking test me.&#x201d;</p><p>And I threw the glass onto the floor. It broke and splashed milk over one of my shoes and up into my sock. I didn&#x2019;t just let it go. I threw that glass down as hard as I could.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>FORTY MINUTES LATER, the psycho bitch and I were tucked like ticks into the back of a Yolo County police car, the matter now being way too big for the guileless campus cops. Handcuffed, too, which hurt my wrists a great deal more than I&#x2019;d ever imagined it would.</p><p>Being arrested had seriously improved the woman&#x2019;s mood. &#x201c;I <i>told</i> him I wasn&#x2019;t fucking around,&#x201d; she said, which was almost exactly what the campus cop had also said to me, only more in sorrow than in triumph. &#x201c;So glad you decided to come with. I&#x2019;m Harlow Fielding. Drama department.&#x201d;</p><p>No shit.</p><p>&#x201c;I never met a Harlow before,&#x201d; I said. I meant a first name Harlow. I&#x2019;d met a last name Harlow.</p><p>&#x201c;Named after my mother, who was named after Jean Harlow. Because Jean Harlow had beauty <i>and</i> brains and <i>not</i> because Gramps was a dirty old man. Not even. But what good did beauty and brains do her? I ask you. Like she&#x2019;s this great role model?&#x201d;</p><p>I knew nothing about Jean Harlow except that she was maybe in <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, which I&#x2019;d never seen nor ever wanted to see. That war is over. Get over it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Rosemary Cooke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rosemary for remembrance,&#x201d; Harlow said. &#x201c;Awesome. Totally, totally charmed.&#x201d; She slid her arms under her butt and then under her legs so her cuffed wrists ended up twisted in front of her. If I&#x2019;d been able to do the same, we could have shaken hands, as seemed to be her intention, but I couldn&#x2019;t.</p><p>We were taken then to the county jail, where this same maneuver created a sensation. A number of policemen were called to watch as Harlow obligingly squatted and stepped over her cuffed hands and back again several times. She deflected their enthusiasm with a winning modesty. &#x201c;I have very long arms,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can never find sleeves that fit.&#x201d;</p><p>Our arresting officer&#x2019;s name was Arnie Haddick. When Officer Haddick took off his hat, his hair was receding from his forehead in a clean, round curve that left his features nicely uncluttered, like a happy face.</p><p>He removed our cuffs and turned us over to ...</p></p><h2>The Book of the Year: A Brief History of Our Seasonal Holidays</h2><p>What is the connection between May Day and the Statue of Liberty? Between ancient solstice fires and Fourth of July fireworks? Between St. Valentine, the Groundhog, and the Virgin Mary? Why do people behave so bawdily during Mardi Gras? How has the significance and celebration of Christmas changed over the centuries? <br> In <em>The Book of the Year</em>, Anthony Aveni offers fascinating answers to these questions and explains the many ways humans throughout time have tried to order and give meaning to time's passing. Aveni traces the origins of modern customs tied to seasonal holidays, exploring what we eat (the egg at Easter, chocolate on St. Valentine's Day), the games we play (bobbing for apples on Halloween, football on Thanksgiving), the rituals we perform (dancing around the Maypole, making New Year's resolutions), and the colorful cast of characters we invent to dramatize holidays (Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the witches and goblins of Halloween). Along the way, Aveni illuminates everything from the Jack 'O Lantern and our faith in the predictive power of animals to the ways in which Labor Day reflects the great medieval "time wars," when the newly invented clock first pitted labor against management. The calendar and its holidays, Aveni writes, function as "a kind of metronome that keeps the beat of human activity tuned to the manifold overlapping cycles of life," to the ebb and flow of birth, growth, decay, and death.<br> Vividly written, filled with facts both curious and astonishing, this engrossing book allows us to hear that beat more clearly and to understand more fully the rhythms we all dance to throughout the year.</p><p><br><strong>Anthony Aveni</strong> is the Russell B. Colgate Professor of Astronomy and Anthropology at Colgate University and the author of several books, including <em>Empires of Time</em> and <em>Conversing with the Planets</em>.<br>Why do we celebrate Easter by telling children that a rabbit will bring them eggs and candy? Why do we make New Year's resolutions? Why do we engage in rituals like bobbing for apples on Halloween, watching football on Thanksgiving, and giving chocolate on Valentine's Day? Aveni, a professor of astronomy and anthropology at Colgate, provides answers to these and many other questions in this delightful little book about the origins and modern development of our holidays. Our red-letter days, he contends, have evolved over the centuries as various cultures use them to reflect specific cultural concerns. For example, Halloween can be traced back to the Celtic festival Samhain, the official first day of winter in early medieval Ireland. On that day, spirits roamed the earth, revisiting their homes, pleading with their relatives for prayers, and eating a warm meal before they returned to their graves. While the modern celebration of Halloween resembles Samhain, Aveni argues that the holiday provides adults with an opportunity to cope with the fear of the unknown by allowing children to dress as ghosts, goblins and spirits. Overall, Aveni contends, we try to gain some control over nature and our lives by capturing the rhythms of the seasons on our calendars and by dividing our lives into segments governed by special days. Although not a thorough and definitive study of seasonal holidays, Aveni's book provides entertaining glimpses into the cultural evolution of holidays, and explores our human desire to make time work in our favor. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>G.I.

More literal, more in-your-face, 70s ads sought to capture the attention of a public accustomed to blaring, to-the-point TV commercials (even VW ads, known for their witty, ironic statements and minimalist designs, lost some of their punch in the 1970s). All was not lost, though; as ads are a sign of the times, racial and ecological awareness crept into everything from cigarette to car advertisements, reminding Americans that everyday products were hip to the modern age. A fascinating study of mass culture dissemination in a post-hippie, television-obsessed nation, this weighty volume delivers an exhaustive and nostalgic overview of 70s advertising.</p><p>The editor: <br>Jim Heimann is a resident of Los Angeles, a graphic designer, writer, historian, and instructor at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.

Now Gerald Astor has chronicled their efforts and accomplishments in this critically acclaimed survey. From Crispus Attucks, the first casualty of the American Revolution, to fighters on both sides of the Civil War, Astor moves to the postwar Indian campaigns and the infamous Brownsville riot. He also documents the prejudices and grievous wrongs that have kept African Americans from service&#x2014;and finally traces their ascent to the highest levels. <i>The Right to Fight</i> is a groundbreaking contribution to American history.</p><p><b>Gerald Astor</b> is a prominent military historian and author whose previous books include <i>A Blood-Dimmed Tide, The Greatest War,</i> and <i>The Mighty Eighth.</i> He lives near New York City.An all-encompassing chronicle of African-Americans' struggles to serve in the armed forces of the US, by popular military historian Astor (The Mighty Eighth, 1997, etc). Beginning with the story of Crispus Attucks, who was killed in the Boston Massacre (and without whom no multicultural textbook is complete), Astor covers the full sweep of the American armed forces in peace and in war, with remarkable clarity and vigor and a degree of research that shows a mastery of military, social, and political history. Although the experiences of blacks in the Civil War has been well documented (and even popularized by Hollywood), the author's account covers the essential details of those who fought for both North and South, and then moves on to look at their situation in the postwar Indian campaigns, the war with Spain, and the famous ``Brownsville riot,'' in which an entire battalion was expelled from the army after a racial disturbance in a Texas town. Astor's work is aptly titled, considering, as it does, the struggle that African-Americans have had to wage to fight for a society that mistrusted their courage under fire. Surprisingly, the wars themselves don't serve as the high points of the narrative; rather, they punctuate the story of grievous wrongs with moments of astonishing bravery and sacrifice - followed by only small gains as peace returned. Of particular poignance are the stories of the men who went to sea, only to be offered positions as ``seagoing bellhops, chambermaids, and dishwashers,'' and were then expelled from the navy when they publicized their plight in a major newspaper. Astor's work is so broad, and his arguments so vital, that it's a shame to give it a label as narrow as ``military history.'' This is a work of major importance in African-American history.

And that in the 1940s girls all across America were crazy for our country's favorite game?<br>These little known facts inspired Shana Corey to imagine a story about how one determined girl made her way to the big leagues &amp; found a sisterhood of players in pigtails. With the same exuberant spirit that fueled the formation of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League, joyful text &amp; jubilant pictures celebrate these brave girls' love of the game &amp; the league they called their own.</p><p>Katie Casey is in a league of her own: "She preferred sliding to sewing, batting to baking, and home runs to homecoming." Unfortunately, baseball is not considered ladylike in 1942. But when the male professional baseball players are called away to war, Katie has her chance to step up to the plate. <i>Players in Pigtails</i>, inspired by the movie <i>A League of Their Own</i>, is a delightful tribute to the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League created by Chicago Cubs owner Phillip Wrigley during World War II. When author Shana Corey (<i>Milly and the Macy&#x2019;s Parade</i>, <i>You Forgot Your Skirt, Amelia Bloomer!</i>) discovered that the lyrics of the popular 1908 song "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" featured a "baseball-mad" girl named Katie Casey, she simply had to share the story with children. Illustrator Rebecca Gibbon captures a gleeful era of women&#x2019;s baseball in cheerful colors and carefully researched 1940s styles. Young readers will enjoy this exuberant, well-paced picture book about good old-fashioned girl power, complete with an informative and engaging author&#x2019;s note about the girls&#x2019; league along with the lyrics to both "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" and the official "Victory Song" of the AAGPBL.

She barely eats, works at night as a cleaner and lives in a tiny attic room. Philibert Marquet de La Durbelliere is a stammering, erudite aristocrat who sells postcards outside a museum. One evening he overcomes his own excruciating reticence to rescue Camille, unconscious, from her freezing garret, and install her in the large, ornate apartment he is caretaking downstairs. He already has an unlikely flatmate, the foul-mouthed, talented working-class young chef, Franck, who is made more obnoxious by guilt about the beloved grandmother he&#39;s had to put in a home. Together, this curious, damaged little quartet may be able to face the world. Gorgeously original, full of wry humour and razor-sharp observation, redolent of Paris, its foibles, its food and its neglected corners, &#34;Hunting and Gathering&#34; is a universal story about despair, love and the virtues of ensemble-playing in a naughty world. It&#39;s a big novel that you will not want to put down.</p><p>Born in 1970, Anna Gavalda was a teacher whose collection of stories, I Wish Someone Were Waiting for Me Somewhere, shot her to fame (published in Vintage together with her novella, Someone I Loved). Her novel Hunting and Gathering (Ensemble c&#39;est tout) was a bestseller in several countries, selling over two million copies, and was made into a film. She is also the author of the novel Consolation. Her books have been translated into thirty-six languages. The mother of two children, she lives and writes just outside Paris.Love cures all that ails the troubled trio of "no-hopers" in this sentimental second novel by French literary sensation Gavalda (<i>Someone I Loved</i>; <i>I Wish Someone Were Waiting for Me Somewhere</i>). Camille, a talented artist exhausted by ennui and anorexia, cleans offices at night and cowers in a shabby garret by day. Philibert, the fastidious scion of a titled family, peddles museum postcards while squatting in his dead grandmother's Parisian manse, waiting for her estate to be settled. Philibert's roommate, Franck, a talented (and womanizing) chef with ambition to burn, motorcycles once a week to look in on his stubborn, ailing grandmother Paulette, an "inmate" at a retirement home. When Philibert finds Camille deathly ill one day, he rescues her from her icy garret and deposits her in his shabby but spacious home. Franck and Camille take an immediate dislike to each other, a sure sign that they're bound to fall in love&#x2014;which happens, cutely, after they liberate Paulette. That's when, "for the first time, each and every one of them felt like they belonged to a real family." Gavalda's comically implausible and comfortably predictable novel of misfits is a Gallic charmer anchored by breezy and poignant storytelling. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

More astute and forbearing, yet more fallible than legend has allowed, Wilde is given here the dimensions of a modern hero. Based on fresh material from many hitherto-untapped sources, Ellmann depicts Wilde&#39;s comet-like ascent on the Victorian scene and his equally dramatic sudden eclipse. His Irish background, the actresses to whom he paid court, his unfortunate wife and lovers, his clothes, coiffures, and the decor of his rooms - all are presented here in vivid detail. The saga of his 1882 American tour is recounted with a wealth of new details; also his later impact on the bastions of the French literary establishment. The London of the Nineties, of Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelites, Lillie Langtry and the Prince of Wales, is evoked alongside Paris of the &#34;belle epoque&#34; and the Greece, Italy and North Africa of Wilde&#39;s travels. Ellmann&#39;s definitive critical account of Wilde&#39;s entire oeuvre shows him as the proponent of a radical new aesthetic who was perilously at odds with Victorian society. After his period of success and daring, the fatal love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas is followed by exposure, imprisonment, a few wretched years abroad and death in exile. The tragic end of Wilde&#39;s life leaves the reader with a sense of compassion and grief for the protagonist. This edition make the popular and best selling biography available in paperback for the first time.</p><p>Richard Ellmann capped an illustrious career in biography (his <i>James Joyce</i> is considered one of the masterpieces of the 20th century) with this life of Oscar Wilde, which won both the National Book Critics Circle Award and Pulitzer Prize on its original publication in 1988. Ellmann's account of Wilde's extravagantly operatic life as poet, playwright, aesthete, and martyr to sexual morality is notable not only for the full portrait it gives of Wilde, but also for Ellmann's assessment of his subject's literary greatness; both aims are served by a plethora of quotations from Wilde's own work and correspondence. Wilde straddled the line between the Victorian age and the modern world as he did everything in life ... with impeccable style.The biography sensitive to the tragic pattern of the story of a great subject: Oscar Wilde - psychologically and sexually complicated, enormously quotable, central to a alluring cultural world and someone whose life assumed an unbearably dramatic shape.</p><h2>HOW TO THINK IN CHESS</h2><p>Demystifies the techniques of chess thinking: don&#39;t just memorize moves, learn how to think in chess.</p><p></p><h2>Do Something!: A Handbook for Young Activists</h2><p>Kids want to do it.

Demonstrating an uninterrupted continunity in the history of ornament from the ancient Egyptian through the Islamic period, Riegl argued that the creative urge manifests itself in both "great art" and the most humble artifact, and that change is an inherent part of style. This new translation, which renders Riegl's seminal work in contemporary, readable prose, allows for a fresh reexamination of his thought in light of current revisionist debate.<br>His discovery of infinite variation in the restatement of several decorative motifs--the palmette, rosette, tendril--led Riegl to believe that art is completely independent from exterior conditions and is beyond individual volition. This thinking laid the groundwork for his famous concept of Kunstwollen, or artistic intention.<br>"Something that the translation will, I hope, convey, is the passion invsted in Riegl's enterprise. We are made to feel that the issues he discussed mattered vitally to him; it was the very nature of art and its relation to human life that were at stake, art as an absolute necessity." --From the preface of Henri Zerner<br>Alois Reigl (1858-1905) was Curator of Textiles at the Museum of Art and Industry in Vienna during most of his career and wrote many influential works on the history of art, including Spatromische Kunstgeschichte.

In &#34;Seven Days in the Art World&#34;, Sarah Thornton, a brilliant young sociologist, looks at all aspects of buying, selling, and creating serious art. Thornton has exceptional access, and brings a keen critical eye to her coverage of this glamorous milieu, offering the first authoritative account of what is now a multi-billion dollar global marketplace-cum-playground for an ever-expanding number of collectors, investors, and enthusiasts.</p><p>SARAH THORNTON contributes regularly to Artforum and ArtReview and is the author of Club Cultures and co-author of The Subcultures Reader. She lives in London.

Enter Thornton, an art historian and sociologist with moxie and a brilliant game plan. Willing to ask obvious questions, she infiltrates the seven circles of this competitive realm. An astute observer and stimulating storyteller whose crisp sentences convey a&nbsp;wealth of information, Thornton marvels at the military precision of a Christie&#x2019;s auction and the wild improvisation of an art-school critique.&nbsp; On to Art Basel, a major international art fair where the &#x201c;hard buy&#x201d; rather than the hard sell is the rule since an artist&#x2019;s reputation is tied to those who own his or her work. Thornton witnesses the final stage in the judging and presentation of the Turner Prize, watches editors at work at Artforum, attends the coveted Venice Biennale, and spends a dizzying day with the wizardly artist-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami. Thornton&#x2019;s uniquely clarifying dispatches from the art front glimmer with high-definition profiles of artists, dealers, critics, and collectors, and grapple with the paradoxes inherent in the transformation of creativity into commodity. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Thea Stilton and the Secret of the Old Castle (Thea Stilton #10): A Geronimo Stilton Adventure</h2><p>Geronimo's sister Thea Stilton narrates this action-packed adventure!<br><br>When the Thea Sisters' friend Bridget returns to Scotland for a family emergency, the five mice offer to help.

Case in point: "When Chili first came to Miami Beach twelve years ago they were having one of their off-and-on cold winters: thirty-four degrees the day he met Tommy Carlo for lunch at Vesuvio's on South Collins and had his leather jacket ripped off." You need to know about this because you need to know why there's bad blood between Chili Palmer and Ray Bones, the guy who stole his coat and is now his boss--and has ordered him to collect $4,200 from a dead guy. Except the guy didn't die; he went to Las Vegas with $300,000. So Chili goes to Las Vegas, one thing leads to another, and pretty soon he's in Los Angeles, hanging out with a movie producer named Harry Zimm and learning what it takes to be a player in Hollywood. <p> <i>Get Shorty</i> is classic Elmore Leonard: While other people write "crime fiction," Leonard's come up with a masterful social comedy that happens to be about criminals (and other fast operators).

But hustling Harry has stiffed a backer, some Miami muscle is headed west to break more than Chili's bubble and suddenly Chili's over his head in "high concepts" -- a Hollywood scam calculated to confound "investors" who make it clear that there are more ways to get killed than at the box office. </p><p>"A master of narrative... a poet of the vernacular...

Sprung (in the first novel) from a virtual prison by Mieli, a powerful woman who offers Jean his freedom in exchange for a service, he must return to his thieving ways and steal something for the pellegrini, a sort of godlike entity. But, even now, Jean still doesn&#x2019;t know exactly why he was busted out of prison, or what, precisely, he&#x2019;s stolen.

Fans of the author&#x2019;s popular debut novel, which mixed hard science with wild fantasy, will probably be lining up for this follow-up, which resolves some of the questions posed in The Quantum Thief but, on the other hand, asks several more, for which there are, as yet, no answers. --David Pitt</p><h2>Practical Leatherwork: Cutting, Sewing, Finishing &amp; Repair</h2><p>Leather is a strong and versatile material, and indispensable when you&#x2019;re working, hunting, or exploring outdoors.

In 1950, Fleur Cowles established what would become one of the most important and talked about magazines ever created. Critically lauded for its sharp mix of clothes, literature, art, travel, decor, theater, and humor, Flair made publishing history with its combination of eclectic editorial content and lavish production quality. Recalled as "the first magazine that became an art form," The Best of Flair is a compilation of the magazine&#x2019;s best content as chosen by the woman who created it. Along with its distinctive production values, Flair also features interviews and contributions from some of the most noted artists and celebrities of the past fifty years, including Lucian Freud, Jean Cocteau, Tallulah Bankhead, Saul Steinberg, Salvador Dal�, Simone de Beauvoir, Walker Evans, James Michener, Ogden Nash, Gypsy Rose Lee, Clare Boothe Luce, George Bernard Shaw, John O&#x2019;Hara, Margaret Mead, and Tennessee Williams. Now, more than ten years after this book was first published by Rizzoli, and more than fifty years after the magazine ceased publication, this facsimile edition offers the same ingenious bookmaking of its predecessor, including multiple gatefolds with die-cuts, booklets, and accordion folder leaflets.</p><p>Fleur Cowles (1908&#x2013;2009) was an American artist, editor, and writer best known for her pioneering and influential work at Flair. Dominick Dunne (1925&#x2013;2009) was an American writer and investigative journalist best known for his contributions to Vanity Fair magazine as well as his true crime novels.&#x201c;This newly affordable archive features greatest hits from one of the most groundbreaking (and short-lived) fashion magazines of all time.

As if the extremely intelligent and varied subject matter was not enough to mesmerize the reader, there is the element of presentation that catapults Flair into rarefied territory that has never since been explored and will probably never ever even be dreamt of today. There are not enough superlatives to offer when speaking of this book so if you have esthetic leanings or interest in almost any cultural aspect of life, then, this book is essential to all those who consider themselves cultivated and sophisticated.

Kotler's original project showed how towns�&#x20ac;&#x201d;once independent but then later annexed by adjacent cities�&#x20ac;&#x201d;became exploited by centralized downtown power. As relevant today as it was when originally published in 1969, <i>Neighborhood Government</i> continues to speak to American cities whose faces have been radically changed by immigration, urban sprawl, and communities fractured by pervasive economic and racial inequality. <br><br>With a new critical foreword by Terry L. Cooper that places the text within contemporary debates and a new foreword and afterword from the author, <i>Neighborhood Government</i> continues to be a vital work for anyone interested in the economic, social, and political health of American cities and the continuing struggle to increase community investment and control.</p><p>Milton Kotler received his M.A. in political science and taught political science at the City College of Chicago. A political strategist and neighborhood organizer for twenty years in the 1960s and 70s, in 1982 Kotler organized Kotler Marketing Group (K.M.G.) to develop new funding sources and revenue programs for non-profit organizations. K.M.G. is a leading marketing strategy and practice company with corporate and non-profit clients throughout the world. For the past six years Kotler has focused his strategic activity in China where he works on urban and industrial development for Chinese municipal authorities. His company also provides strategic and tactical marketing support to Chinese companies to improve their business performance in Chinese and global markets.A generation ago, the scholar-activist Milton Kotler blazed a new trail towards authentic grassroots democracy. Today, as theorists urge more deliberation and community reformers seek new arenas for civic participation, Kotler's recommendations are more relevant than ever. This new edition of <i>Neighborhood Government</i> should refocus attention on the ways that restructured local institutions can empower citizens. (William A. Galston)<br><br>In an America split between people enjoying the serenity of gated enclaves, condominiums, and prosperous suburbs, and people struggling with debts, job uncertainty, and the powerlessness of most small communities, Kotler forcefully reminds us of the potential for grass roots resurgence that can enable citizens of distressed communities to level the field and remake their own living places. This book comes to us in a period of general crisis, with families and small communities made frustrated and helpless by social, economic, and political threats, both foreign and domestic. It supplies new evidence of the possibility for citizens to provoke changes in many of the nations 60,000 place communities. Recent research and experience with colleagues supports Kotler's worldview and model. In this time of civic confusion, it is heartening to have the sobering, demanding voice of Milton Kotler providing renewed and expanded ideas as to how the small communities of America can themselves take on the tasks ofachieving homeland security infused with liberty and fairness.

This is a "snapshot" of Houdini's life, centering on one of his most famous jumps. As Houdini prepares for a death-defying leap into the icy Charles River in Boston, biographer Jason Lutes and artist Nick Bertozzi reveal Houdini's life and influence: from the anti-Semitism Houdini fought all his life, to the adulation of the American public; from his hounding by the press, to his loving relationship with his wife Bess; from his egoism to his insecurity; from his public persona -- to the secret behind his most amazing trick! And it's all in graphic form, so it's fresh, original, and unlike anything previously published about this most fascinating of American showmen. <br>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Jason Lutes is a cartoonist living in Seattle. He has been an admirer of Houdini for most of his adult life, and his celebrated graphic novel for adults, Jar of Fools, also pays homage to the Handcuff King.*Starred Review* Following Houdini on the morning of his leap (while handcuffed) into the frigid Boston River, readers gain a remarkably complete picture of his world. They will meet his wife, Bess; his strong-arm man, Beatty; reporters desperate to get a quote; and crowds hungry for a glimpse of him. Most of all, they get to know Houdini himself, who, as an extensive introduction notes, was probably the most famous man in the world at the time. Proud and obsessed--with his skill, his fame, and his wife--Houdini was a showman of the highest order who knew he represented hope to his adoring American public. He also knew that he had an unprecedented talent for self-hype. Avoiding overt, showy tricks themselves, Lutes and Bertozzi^B use clean, simple storytelling and crisp, clear black-and-white art to create not only a portrait of the man but also that sense of suspense and anticipation Houdini generated in his performances. Endnotes linked to specific pictures offer background on everything from anti-Semitism (Houdini was Jewish) to handcuffs. A bibliography of mostly older adult titles is appended. <i>Jesse Karp</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The book is a multifarious conversation about the value of artworks and the labor and bodies that make them, especially as defined by institutions with whom artists have often had fraught relationships. In essays, poems, interviews and artworks, 19 contributors consider artworks that resist institutional parameters; how and why performers, choreographers and dancers might go about making art institutions into proper venues for their works; and how race figures into assessments of value. <i>On Value</i> emerges from Value Talks, a series of private conversations organized by Lemon in 2013 and 2014 at MoMA.</p><p></p><h2>Lejeune Film Reader</h2><p>C.A.Lejeune was among the first professional film critics in the world., her columns in &#39;The Observer&#39; commanding a huge readership. her career spanned the rise, the great days of the industry and the dawn of the television age. She saw the coming of sound and colour, the advent of the star systems and the wide screen. Her column was read for its percipience, humour, kindliness and good writing by people who never went to the cinema at all. This comprehensive section of her articles, essays and review, from silent film to the 1960s, has an autobiographical element. She tells how she became a critic and what criticism means; she recalls her long acquaintance with Alfred Hitchcock and Alexander Korda, Leslie Howard and Robert Donat, personalities - unforgettable and unforgotten - who gave British cinema its finest hours. For students of film history, this is essential reading. For lovers of old films, it is an instructive and nostalgic delight. And like, C.A. Lejeune&#39;s column, it will appeal to any reader who likes good writing and civilised values.

She has written for both children and adults, and her poetry has received many awards, including the Signal Prize for Children&#39;s Verse, the Whitbread and Forward Prizes, and the Lannan and E. M. Forster Prize in America. In 2005, she won the T. S. Eliot Prize for Rapture. She was appointed Poet Laureate in 2009.The voices of Mrs. Tiresias, Mrs. Faust, Mrs. Quasimodo and other wives wittily recast myth and history from a woman's point of view in the pages of Manchester-based Duffy's fifth collection. Self-contained Penelope is not waiting for her Odysseus; frustrated Mrs. Sisyphus is married to a workaholic; Pygmalion's statue, tired of being pestered by her groping suitor, "changed tack/ grew warm, like candle wax/ kissed back"--and after sex gets dumped. But while Duffy's revisionist dramatic monologues are rife with clever twists, this material has been well mined by such poets as Alta, Margaret Atwood and Alicia Ostriker. Even references to Viagra, sheep-cloning and Monica Lewinsky seem an updating of Transformations (1971), Anne Sexton's deadpan fairy tales studded with cultural references, with the poems trapped in a similarly polarized conception of gender relations. Thus Thetis is brutalized in a new way each time she changes form--man is cross-bow to her albatross, charmer to her snake, fisherman to her mermaid--and to Queen Herod, the Christ child is simply a threat to her infant girl: he's "The Wolf. The Rip. The Rake. The Rat./The Heartbreaker. The Ladykiller. Mr. Right." The luckiest in love is Mrs. Beast, married to a devoted creature that's hung like a mule, and just as hardworking: "And if his snot and trotters fouled/ my damask sheets, why, then, he'd wash them. Twice." The flippant tone elicits chuckles, but one imagines these characters would've come a longer way by now, baby. (Apr.) FYI: Duffy's anthology Time's Tidings: Greeting the 21st Century includes 50 contemporary poets, each of whom is represented by a poem of his or her own on "time," and by a favorite poem on the same subject.

A half century after its initial appearance, Bradbury's fourth published book remains vivid and memorable. The original table of contents is restored (under Joe Mugnaini's iconic original cover art), with Bradbury's familiar and characteristically wistful, dreamy fantasy, such as The April Witch, a haunting tale of teenage dream-traveler Cecy and her desperate desire for romance, mingling with brilliant science fiction like the title story and the widely reprinted A Sound of Thunder. A few pieces have not aged so well, such as The Big Black and White Game, a clumsy discussion of race that was bold for its time but does little for the modern reader, but they're well balanced by the inclusion of two charming short plays: The Fog Horn, an incomplete radio play that inspired the iconic if maladapted film <i>The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms</i>, and En la Noche, which succeeds on page or stage, like most Bradbury, as a story of human sensitivities. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Crapol examines Blaine's pivotal role in shaping American foreign relations and looks at some of the underlying reasons why the U.S. acquired an overseas empire at the turn of the century. This text will acquaint readers with how Blaine sought to win global economic supremacy and intended to transform the U.S. into the world's number one power. The book also lends insight into Blaine's efforts to spark energetic governmental action in revitalizing the merchant marine, building a first-class navy, using the coercive tactic of reciprocity, achieving unilateral control of an isthmian canal, and creating U.S. political and economic hegemony in the hemisphere. In addition, <i>James G.

Based in large part on the author's exclusive access to MacDonald's private papers, including her unpublished memoir, this vivid, often touching biography transports us to a time when lavish musical films were major cultural events and a worldwide public eagerly awaited each new chance to fall under the singer's spell. Edward Baron Turk shows how MacDonald brilliantly earned her Hollywood nickname of "Iron Butterfly," and why she deserves a privileged position in the history of music and motion pictures.<br><br>What made MacDonald a woman for <i>our</i> times, readers will discover, was her uncommon courage: Onscreen, the actress portrayed strong charcters in pursuit of deep emotional fulfillment, often in defiance of social orthodoxy, while offscreen she personified energy, discipline, and practical intellect. Drawing on interviews with individuals who knew her and on MacDonald's own words, Turk brings to life the intricate relations between the star and her legendary costars Maurice Chevalier, Clark Gable, and, above all, baritone Nelson Eddy. He reveals the deep crushes she inspired in movie giants Ernst Lubitsch and Louis B. Mayer and the extraordinary love story she shared with her husband of twenty-seven years, actor Gene Raymond.<br><br>More than simply another star biography, however, this is a chronicle of American music from 1920s Broadway to 1960s television, in which Turk details MacDonald's fearless efforts to break down distinctions between High Art and mass-consumed entertainment. <i>Hollywood Diva</i> will attract fans of opera and concert music as much as enthusiasts of the great Hollywood musicals.

The bushes were about ten feet away from the path that went toward the Annex, the low building hooked onto the back of the Captain Duncan Oakes School. He was hiding because he knew that Robert Gerritt was going to come walking along here on his way to school in a few minutes, and when he did, Ben was going to jump up and scare the daylights out of him.<br> <br>It was kind of a stupid idea, but Ben didn&#x2019;t care. This was just for fun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and also because Gerritt was usually way too serious. A jolt of good old-fashioned panic might loosen the guy up a little.<br> <br>It hardly seemed like a good moment to be goofing around&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that was sort of the point. Yes, the Glennley Group was still planning to demolish the Captain Oakes School this week; and yes, he and Jill and Robert only had two and half days left to stop all that; and yes, once they went inside, the rest of today was going to be risky and stressful and intense. But right now? Time to mess around.<br> <br>Then something caught Ben&#x2019;s eye, there at the back door of the Annex, the door to the playground.<br> <br>Is that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;? Yes!<br> <br>It was Wally, lurking in the hallway.<br> <br>Wally and his boss, Mr. Lyman, worked for the Glennley Group, but they had also been posing as the school janitors, so they were in the building every day.<br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t know exactly what Ben and Jill and Robert were up to&#x2014;and they certainly didn&#x2019;t know that the three kids were part of a secret group called the Keepers of the School. And Lyman and Wally also didn&#x2019;t know that the Keepers had a list of clues and that they had already located a bunch of things that the founder of the school had hidden back in the 1700s&#x2014;things that Captain Oakes had hoped could be used as safeguards to protect his legacy.<br> <br>But the two fake janitors did know that the kids were looking for something inside the school and that they were dead set against the new theme park that the Glennley company was planning to build here once the school was torn down. So, the two men simply tried to watch them&#x2014;all day, every day.<br> <br>Ben had to squint a little to see Wally because of the reflection on the glass of the door, but the guy was definitely there. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so what? Was that any reason to pass up a perfect chance to prank Gerritt? No way!<br> <br>Ben was sweating like crazy. This was supposed to turn into a really hot day, and it was already about eighty degrees and very humid. But he tried to ignore the discomfort&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and also the huge bumblebees that buzzed among the pink and white blossoms.<br> <br>It was seven fifty-eight now, and he watched as two buses came rumbling into the driveway. Then glancing back to his left, he spotted Robert. He was coming toward the back of the school along the path from School Street, head down, lost in thought, walking like he was in a huge hurry&#x2014;same as always.<br> <br>Ben crouched lower, ready to leap up and scream like a madman.<br> <br>But before he could move, the door at the back corner of the Annex opened and Wally rushed out. The stocky little man walked quickly across the playground and stopped right in front of Robert, who looked up at him, totally surprised.<br> <br>Ben wasn&#x2019;t close enough to hear what the man said, but five seconds later he saw Robert&#x2019;s reaction perfectly. Gerritt actually shoved Wally! He pushed right past him, and then yelled, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know anything!&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert steamed ahead past the Annex and went toward the old building, joining the crowd of kids who had gotten off the buses. Wally watched Gerritt a moment, and then, after a shifty look around the school yard, he hurried back to the door he&#x2019;d come from.<br> <br>Ben sat still for about half a minute, completely stunned. Then he backed away through the bushes, picked his way out to Washington Street, and ended up standing beside the seawall in front of the school.<br> <br>The water of Barclay Bay lay flat and calm; hardly a ripple. There was a stream of dark smoke from the funnel of a distant ship, well out to sea. But Ben barely saw it, barely heard the gulls that wheeled above him, their cries sharp in the still morning air.<br> <br>He felt like he&#x2019;d just seen something important. Why had Wally wanted to have a secret conversation with Robert? And what could have made Robert react like that?<br> <br><br> <br>Well, I could text Gerritt right now, tell him I saw the whole thing, and ask him what&#x2019;s up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>But it might be better to deal with it later, when they could talk face-to-face. Because he&#x2019;d meet up with Robert during second period language arts, for sure. And if that wasn&#x2019;t the right time, they could talk at lunch.<br> <br>&#x2019;Cause I don&#x2019;t want Gerritt to think I was spying on him or something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Besides, maybe Robert would text him during homeroom and tell him all about it.<br> <br>Yeah, I&#x2019;d better wait.</p><h2>Paper Pools</h2><p>Describes and illustrates the artist&#39;s original technique of fusing paper pulp and paper to depict images produced from photographs of the interplay of light and water within a swimming pool</p><p></p><h2>Teen Titans Go!

Due in no small part to the pioneering work of Peter Burke, the tools of the cultural historian are now routinely brought to bear on every aspect of history, and have transformed our understanding of the past.First published in 1978, this study examines the broad sweep of pre-industrial Europe&#39;s popular culture. From the world of the professional entertainer to the songs, stories, rituals and plays of ordinary people, it shows how the attitudes and values of the otherwise inarticulate shaped - and were shaped by - the shifting social, religious and political conditions of European society between 1500 and 1800.This third edition of Peter Burke&#39;s groundbreaking study has been published to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the book&#39;s publication in 1978. It provides a new introduction reflecting the growth of cultural history, and its increasing influence on &#39;mainstream&#39; history, as well as an extensive supplementary bibliography which further adds to the information about new research in the area.</p><p>Peter Burke is a Professor at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, UK.&#39;...

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi believes this also gives them the responsibility to provide for the needs, not just of their workforce, but of the community in its largest sense. This book helps those in power towards a new understanding and vision of what it means to be a leader. The people interviewed here - including Peter Bijur (CEO of Texaco), Michael Markkula (co-founder of Apple Computer), Anita Roddick (founder of The Body Shop) and Ted Turner (vice chairman of AOL Time Warner) are recognised both for their success and because they care for more than success. Their case studies provide a blueprint for doing business that is good, not just in the material sense, but also on spiritual and ethical levels. Good Business shows leaders and managers - and employees - how to contribute to the development of an enjoyable life that provides meaning, to a society that is just and evolving, and ultimately to the sum of human happiness.</p><p>In psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's definition of leadership, the personal is political. The best-selling author of <i>Flow</i> interviewed several dozen exemplary CEOs whose wisdom provides the radical job description of the book&#x2019;s premise: "Leaders must make it possible for employees to work with joy, to their heart&#x2019;s content, while responding to the needs of society." Csikszentmihalyi leverages his definition of "flow"&#x2014;-the capacity for full engagement in an activity&#x2014;-to create a blueprint for a workplace in which bringing out the best in workers comes before products and profit. When leaders select and reward employees who find satisfaction at work, they can create an upwardly moral organization.<p> In this view, leadership is a privilege that requires checking ego in the coatroom and peering into the mirror to ask tough questions. For example, "How do I determine if something is right or wrong?" Or, "What is my business doing to benefit human well being?" He offers some inspiring stories from leaders who engage employees to go with the flow, including Body Shop CEO Anita Roddick, Patagonia crown prince Yvon Chouinard, and media mogul Ted Turner. Some of Csikszentmihalyi&#x2019;s advice will sound familiar. Yet he creates a compellingly fresh vision of good business in both a material and spiritual sense. Ultimately, the success of this book lies in its powerful, non-flaky ability to define corporate soul in terms of a company becoming a stakeholder in an entity larger than itself.--<i>Barbara Mackoff</i></p>MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI, a Hungarian-born polymath and Professor of Psychology and Education at the University of Chicago, is the author of several popular books about his theories on the psychology of optimal experience, including the best-selling Flow.</p><h2>Kung Fu Meditations and Chinese Proverbial Wisdom</h2><p>A violent man will die a violent death.

Delve further into the carnage that took place around the world, in which unscrupulous and money grabbing individuals from the Northumbrian coast in England to the Everglades in America, would callously slaughter whole colonies of birds (leaving their young to die) purely to provide the millinery trade with ornate feathers to decorate fashionable hats during that era.<br><br>The book also takes the reader into the world of millinery sweatshops of poverty stricken New York and describes the conditions and deprivations under which the poorly paid workers, many of them immigrants, worked.

When I was in graduate school at the University of Mississippi, I found myself party to a drunken kidnapping and ended up in a rowboat in the middle of a lake at 2:00 A.M. with an hysterical Southern belle who kept hissing: "Kill him, Wade, kill him!"Suddenly I wondered: How did I get into this? What am I doing here? How was it possible that a sane young woman like myself could merge so effortlessly into a situation that bizarre?The answer came to me just as suddenly. I was not sane, I was a Southerner. It is interesting to speculate on the moment when a child first realizes that he or she is a Southerner. No one ever actually tells him he is one, but something always occurs at a very tender age that helps fix it in his mind. The moment of truth tends to arrive in a burst of comprehension, following an incident in which an important truth suddenly becomes perfectly clear despite the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever. Once a child successfully negotiates this psychological legerdemain and snatches chaos from the jaws of logic, he wins his crossed cavalry sabers.My red-letter moment occurred in the Year Eight of Franklin D. Roosevelt as I stood in front of the candy counter at Woolworth's. The sign on the counter read: TAR BABIES 20� LB. Inside the bin was amountain of little licorice candies shaped like black children. Everyone privately called them "nigger babies," but my grandmother had taught me that using the word "nigger" was one of those things no lady could do and still remain a lady. Granny wouldn't even say "tar." And so, to avoid hurting the feelings of the blacks who were standing up at the end of the segregated lunch counter where she was seated, she swiveled around on her stool and called out to me:"Do you want some babies to eat in the movies?"As the blacks looked up and stared at her, everything fell into place. Granny was an arch-segregationist with perfect manners; it's all right to segregate people as long as you don't hurt their feelings. Furthermore it is much better to be known as a white cannibal than as white trash who uses words like "nigger," because to a Southerner it is faux pas, not sins, that matter in this world.I bought a nickel bag of tar babies, and Granny and I went off to the movies. The film was H. Rider Haggard's <i>She</i>, which I assumed would be a newsreel about Mrs. Roosevelt. (I had grown up hearing: "It's not his fault, <i>she</i> made him do it. <i>She</i> got them all stirred up, <i>she</i> thinks they're just as good as <i>she</i> is.") I sat through the film waiting for the First Lady to appear. Finally, when the withered old woman died in the snows of Tibet, I asked Granny: "Is that Mrs. Roosevelt?"She snorted and said: "Would that it were."For the second time that day, I heard the click of regional identity in my brain. Now I understood how it was possible for my family to worship FDR despite all the things he had done during his administrations that enraged them. They had used Southern logic to "straighten everything out just fine." It was very simple: Credit Franklin, better known as He, for all the things you like, and blame Eleanor, better known as She or "that woman," for all the things you don't like. This way, He was cleared, She was castigated, and We were happy.Once my regionalism was launched, there was no stopping the stockpile of Southern contradiction that built up in my mind. As we emerged from the movie, Granny was busy making a grocery list and did not notice that I was still eating tar babies. But suddenly she turned, looked down, and gave me the Southern woman's all-powerful silent reproach known as "freezing." This is a look that needs no words. It is an exercise in pained hauteur and courageous endurance topped off with flaring nostrils and a stiffening just this side of rigor mortis. Despitemy tender age, I knew instantly what it meant without being told: Ladies don't eat on the street. Granny did not have to tell me why, because my burgeoning Southern instincts told me: It looked <i>trashy.</i>I already knew that ladies did not smoke on the street. My mother, who smoked five packs of Lucky Strike Greens a day, was always announcing an oncoming nicotine fit with a fluttery moan, an unfinished gesture toward her handbag, and her favorite dire pronouncement: "If I don't have a cigarette, I'm goin' to fall down dead." Yet as much as she loved tobacco, I had never seen her smoke on the street. I had seen her shake on the street and I had heard her become incoherent on the street, but she had never smoked alfresco because it looked trashy.No one ever told me what "trashy" meant, but I never asked because I can't remember ever <i>not</i> knowing. As any Southerner can verify, the definition of trashy is trashy.Granny and I went to the Fourteenth Street arcade market after the show. It took us nearly an hour to make our way down the sawdust-covered main aisle--Granny had to stop and "pass the time of day" with everyone she knew, which was just about everyone in the market. She sailed in, a two-hundred-pound neighborhood chatelaine in a lace bertha, bifocals, and a ten-year-old Empress Eug�nie hat tilted at a rakish angle.Instantly, the air was thick with her Tidewater Virginia drawl and those view halloos worthy of John Peel that she emitted every time she saw a friend. Traffic in the aisle was soon backed up to the Bundles for Britain booth beside the front door, but Granny talked on, the spotted veil on her hat fluttering like an ensign in a high wind."Oh, look, there's Miz Whitmore! OOO-HOO! Miz Whitmore! You come right over here this very minute! I haven't seen you since the fall of Rome!"She meant two Saturdays ago, but I suddenly understood the principle behind the Southern internal time clock. Granny, a genealogy buff, was sunk like a Wasp dinosaur in the muck of prehistory, in love with any bygone age she could lay her hands on.Another regional click: What is past is perfect.After Granny had finished making her gracious way down the aisle, we bought a "mess" of pickled pigs' feet, a "mess" of oysters in the shell, and a "mess" of Maryland soft-shell crabs. Then, laden downwith enough unfit edibles to make us stagger, we stopped by the kosher deli for a "mess" of bagels, which Granny persisted in calling doughnuts."How do, Mr. Silverman! How in the world are you? Law, I haven't seen you since the Age of Pericles!""But you were here day before yesterday, Mrs. Ruding," Mr. Silverman pointed out. I looked at him strangely, realizing for the first time that he never picked up on Granny's figures of speech."Let me have a mess of your wonderful doughnuts, please, sir."Again, he looked puzzled."How many?""Twelve," said Granny.It was not the first time I had heard these two confuse each other, but now I gave some hard thought to their communication problem. How could anyone not know what a "mess" was? <i>Everybody</i> knew that it meant a dozen or a pound, unless, of course, it meant a bushel or a peck, or, in the country, a truckload. My maturing Southern mind conceived a clear, concise picture of a "mess." It was a neatly arranged and properly weighed collection of anything edible. If it was more than the usual unspecified amount, it was a "nice mess."It was to be many years before I realized how Mr. Silverman must have felt. Day after day, he had to stand in his hospital-clean store and listen to Southerners order a mess of his beautiful, ritually slaughtered, and rabbinically approved foods.&nbsp;<br>It has been said that when two Greeks meet they will start a restaurant, two Germans will start an army, and two Englishmen will start a silence. It is not necessary for two Southerners to meet in order to start something because we have taken a little nervous problem called schizophrenia and raised it to the level of a high art. When one-half of a Southerner meets the other half, the result is folie � deux.It is this simple fact that Yankees always miss.The best-known Yankee who missed it was that nineteenth-century traveler, Frederick Law Olmstead. Judging from his journals, his mind was blown soon after he set foot across the Mason-Dixon line.A much more recent casualty was one Dr. Jonathan Latham of Boston, who wanted to win the Pulitzer prize in regional studies.It all began on a Southbound plane, in which Dr. Latham was contentedly sipping a Scotch-on-the-rocks as he planned his scholarly attack on bourbon country. He was headed for a small city in Dixie, armed with an attach� case filled with three-by-five cards, which no Yankee sociologist can live without, and a heavily underlined copy of <i>The Mind of the South,</i> by Wilbur J. Cash, which no Yankee sociologist can live with--because, after all, Cash was himself a Southerner and therefore incapable of cool objectivity, that quality which alone can solve the mystery of Southern psychology.Dr. Latham, a wholehearted believer in the infallibility of the scientific method, was firmly convinced that his frequency charts and cluster-grouping graphs would triumph over the Southern penchant for irrational behavior and contradictory thought processes. He knew his forthcoming book about the South would be a brilliant success because he intended, with the aid of the objectivity for which he was deservedly famous, to drive the spike of logic through the opaque mist of contradiction and paradox that floats like a vapor over every Southerner's head.Warmed by this pleasant thought, Latham took out his copy of <i>Gone with the Wind</i> ...</p><h2>The Railway Detective Omnibus: The Railway Detective/ The Excursion Train/ The Railway Viaduct (The Railway Detective Series)</h2><p>Collected together for the first time, the first three novels in Marston&#39;s Victorian mystery series1851.

There's no denying that a good laugh is very good medicine for the soul, and it's with a keen eye that Coverly finds humor in everything -- from (un)routine office visits to inhospitable hospital stays. &nbsp;For example, there's a doctor confessing to his patient, ''I'll be the first to admit, the results of your autopsy were very surprising,'' or a couple sitting with their newborn as an officer appears to say, ''I'm sorry, ma'am, but there was a mix-up at the hospital, and we think you brought home the wrong husband,'', or a surgeon explaining, ''We put a screw in your hip, and since you were under, we figured we'd just tighten the loose one in your head.''</p><p>Dave Coverly admits there is no overriding theme, no tidy little philosophy that precisely describes what his single panel cartoons know as Speed Bump is about. ''Basically,'' he says, ''if life were a movie, these would be the outtakes.''These ''outtakes'' now appear in over 400 newspapers and Web sites, including the Washington Post, Toronto Globe &amp; Mail, Detroit Free Press, Chicago Tribune, Indianapolis Star, Cleveland Plain Dealer, and many more.

The author discusses how he, a Jew from the Bronx, dedicated most of his professional life to the advancement of civil rights for blacks. In an expressive and often humorous style, Greenberg recalls the days of segregation, when black and white civil rights attorneys often feared for their lives. The book's strongest points include a full, human portrait of the late Thurgood Marshall, who headed the LDF prior to becoming a federal judge and then a Supreme Court justice. Greenberg brings many of the characters involved in the civil rights struggle to life with personal anecdotes while explaining the issues of constitutional law in a way that laypeople can understand. He provides perspective on the role of Jews in the civil rights movement, saying that it has often been overstated. His account of the drama leading up to the Brown v. Board of Education decision is particularly compelling. He also does not hesitate to criticize President Eisenhower for, in his view, failing to provide strong leadership in integration. Greenberg fully grasps the irony of a protest aimed at him when he was asked to teach a civil rights course at Harvard: The Black Law Students Association there objected to the notion of a white man--also a Jew--teaching such a class. Greenberg, who went on to teach law at Columbia, is neither self-righteous nor sanctimonious as he delineates how legal changes engendered by the NAACP LDF affected daily life in America. Yet, despite past victories, he is only too aware of the continuing, desperate plight of the African-American underclass. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Tour.</p><p>Barry Yourgrau has always put his own peculiar spin on sudden fiction. His short bursts of prose are as compact as Zen koans and possess the eeriness of detective stories spliced with dreams. In <i>Haunted Traveller: An Imaginary Memoir</i>, an unnamed narrator (who may or may not be Yourgrau himself) recounts various adventures in 44 thematically linked stories. Meandering by boat, foot, plane, soap bubble, and armchair, our traveler finds himself strikingly out of place among the natives of various lands. He does his best to adapt to the cultures of each region, removing his teeth to ward off evil spirits, booking passage on a tramp steamer with a crew of cross-dressing revolutionaries, and enjoying a variety of amorous entanglements along the way. Yourgrau is at his most winning when his traveler's internal disorientation fits hand-in-glove with his outlandish surroundings, as in this passage, where he finds himself decapitated in a dream: <blockquote> Bizarrely, I catch a glimpse of myself in a gilded mirror: a headless, traumatized figure in gore-rimmed torn pajamas, drink in hand, floating the lamest of bon mots at a crowd of swank, grotesquely ignorant party-goers--in a warm, sumptuous paradise of a room, amid ornate carpets and polished things gleaming in lamplight. The metaphor is so calamitously apt to my life, so cruel, I almost sob with sputtering laughter at myself. </blockquote> What separates Barry Yourgrau from the surrealist-of-the-month club is the close attention he pays to emotional as well as physical landscapes. There's a subtle feeling driving these stories, something between the thrill of discovery and fear of the unknown. Ultimately, it's this combination that keeps <i>Haunted Traveller</i> so compelling once the journey's over. <i>--Ryan Boudinot</i><br><br><b>Barry Yourgrau</b> is a writer and performance artist.

A. Perez was born in Haileybury, Ontario, Canada. The idea for The Slopes of War took shape after a family visit to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Touched by the terrible and significant battle that had been fought there, the author felt that although much had been written about the event itself, little had ever captured what was going on in the hearts and minds of the residents when the war rumbled to their doorsteps in July 1863.Grade 8&#x2013;10&#x2014;Focusing on the few days of the Battle at Gettysburg, this novel creates a clear picture of what it might have been like to be a part of this period of history. The lives of characters fighting for both sides of the war, as well as those who are Gettysburg residents, all intertwine as readers observe the events as they unfold. Bekah, a teenager, helps her mother, who houses and cares for wounded soldiers from both armies, while she worries about her brother, a Union soldier, and her cousin and love interest, who fights for the Confederacy. The point of view switches among these three young people throughout the novel. Actual historical figures also appear in the story, giving it a feeling of realism. This novel does not hide the blood, guts, and heartbreak of war, nor does it underplay the strength of the human will. Rosemary Wells's <i>Red Moon at Sharpsburg</i> (Viking, 2007) similarly showed the realities of the Civil War but with more distinguished writing. Perez's book has a faster pace and centers on a specific battle. It's a good follow-up for those who enjoyed Wells's book.&#x2014;<i>Sharon Senser McKellar, Oakland Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A former lawyer and an amateur historian, he lives in the Southwest with his wife, Jan.<p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The Change as Setting and Secondary World</p><p>There are a number of perils you can encounter when building a fictional world, particularly if you intend to set a number of stories in it. Running out of story you really want to tell, which induces boredom, is one&#x2014;Arthur Conan Doyle eventually desperately tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes, whose fame was obscuring the historical novels that he felt (with some justification, they&#x2019;re very good) were his best work. Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x2019; reputation would probably be much higher if he&#x2019;d written only the first three or four books in his Tarzan and John Carter of Mars series, though more with the former than the latter. Africa was wall-to-wall Lost Races and Lost Cities by the 1940s, and you&#x2019;d think some would show up from the cabins of the Imperial Airways planes flying over it by then.</p><p>Which brings up another potential problem: simply <i>running out of space</i>, even if you want to continue and have stories to tell.</p><p>Patrick O&#x2019;Brian ran into this problem with his wonderful Aubrey-Maturin series, set during the Napoleonic Wars; eventually he was reduced to unofficially splitting the year 1813 into, as it were, 1813a and 1813b&#x2014;sort of alternate history versions of the penultimate year!</p><p>The wars against Napoleon spanned more than a decade; if you throw in the beginning of the struggle against Revolutionary France it covers a full generation&#x2014;around twenty-five years, with one short truce. Men like Stephen Maturin and &#x201c;Lucky&#x201d; Jack Aubrey would have spent their entire adult careers in the period between the fall of the Bastille and Napoleon&#x2019;s exile to Saint Helena, and by the end of it most of their subordinates would have been <i>born</i> into the wars. That&#x2019;s more than enough for a series of books!</p><p>What tripped O&#x2019;Brian up was simply that he didn&#x2019;t anticipate how many books he <i>would</i> be writing with this (quite large) cast of characters, and so passed over a good many years as he skipped between the time periods of the earlier books.</p><p>I took this lesson to heart when starting the novels of the Change, what some call the Emberverse. It tied into another desire, that of making a world that felt <i>ample</i>. Even if you&#x2019;re worldbuilding for a single novella, it should feel &#x201c;big,&#x201d; not fading into nothingness beyond the tight frame, not &#x201c;thin.&#x201d; The characters should be aware of an entire universe around them, full of people and things going about their own business. Look at our own world, even in this age of globalization when there&#x2019;s scarcely a city on the planet where you can&#x2019;t ask directions or order lunch in English. How vast and varied and interesting it is, both in terms of nature and of how human beings live on it and with each other!</p><p>Many of the great fantasists&#x2014;Le Guin, Howard, Tolkien, Martin&#x2014;have achieved this feeling of having an entire world that exists on its own, with the narrative taking place in only part of it. Howard was one of my early influences; I spent a hot cross-country trip in the late sixties dripping watermelon juice on the Lancer <i>Conans</i> as my family drove an un-air-conditioned car from New Jersey to Los Angeles.</p><p>He achieved it by using what was supposedly, like Tolkien&#x2019;s Middle Earth, the remote past of our world. Even the maps of the Hyborian Age and Middle Earth are similar, if you look carefully. Both Tolkien and Howard did glorious mashups (the concept is older than the term) of historical cultures in their antediluvian worlds. Tolkien has late-medieval Gondor, Anglo-Saxon riders of Rohan, largely Nordic Dwarves, Regency English yokel hobbits, vaguely Middle Eastern and Central Asian Easterlings and Corsairs, plus the totalitarian nightmare of Mordor, with its pollution and its population known by their file-numbers. Howard went completely berserk, and had high-camp-medieval Aquilonians, English longbowman Bossonians, ancient Egyptians in Stygia, Afghans in (where else?) Afghulistan, and something close to nineteenth-century Zulus and Sudanese on the &#x201c;Black Coast.&#x201d; Not to mention Vikings, Cossacks, Bedouin, archaic-Semitic more or less Assyrians and Babylonians in the cities of Shem with their ziggurats and brass idols, seventeenth-century buccaneers, eighteenth-century pirates, Turks, Renaissance Spaniards, and Picts who are pretty much Iroquois as seen by the frontiersmen of the Mohawk valley with the odd demon and giant snake thrown into the slumgullion for flavor.</p><p>Conan, of course, was essentially pre-Christian Irish, and cheerfully chopped up an entire multicultural host of opponents without fear or favor.</p><p>Taking the planet Earth (geographical amplitude and variety) and historically attested cultures (human, ditto) solves the most basic problem of worldbuilding; it&#x2019;s extremely hard to come up with an entire world and its inhabitants and be convincing, to avoid thinness and sameness as everything takes on the cast of your own mind. Not to mention your own limitations with regard to geography and ecology. Hence the multitudes of one-note planets in science fiction; desert world, ice world, and so forth, often inhabited by races who have only one &#x201c;hat&#x201d; or trait. Super-logical, super-emotional, super-aggressive, you name it! As the saying goes, worldbuilding is good occupational therapy for lunatics who think they&#x2019;re God, and a lesson in the almost paralyzing complexity and interconnectedness of reality.</p><p>This has become the Stock Fantasy World; an ancient or parallel Earth with historically based cultures. This can be done well (Westeros) or badly (I shall not specify, and let the libel lawyers starve). It has the virtue of giving you an unlimited canvas; after all, our own Earth is the &#x201c;worldbuilding project&#x201d; of endless mimetic fiction.</p><p>Another possible setting is the post-apocalyptic wasteland, where a &#x201c;new future past&#x201d; creates analogues to historical settings; Andre Norton was fond of this and did it very well.</p><p>Which brings me to the world of the Change.</p><p>When I set out to do the Nantucket trilogy (beginning with <i>Island in the Sea of Time</i>) I knew that I&#x2019;d eventually return to the world Nantucket left behind when it was plunged into 1250 BCE. And that as that ancient world received the technology of the late twentieth century when a community of thousands of Americans from 1998 was dumped into its midst, so the world left behind would be denied the high-energy-density technologies. Electronics and electricity; heat engines of all kinds; and the electrochemical and high-pressure, high-energy chemical processes dependent on them.</p><p>That gave me the big world&#x2014;ours&#x2014;to work with, rendered even bigger by the sudden removal of fast communications and travel. Naturally, losing the technological basis of the great world-machine in 1998 would cause unimaginable chaos and destruction, comparable to a full-scale global thermonuclear exchange at the peak of the Cold War in immediate devastation and removing the possibility of reconstruction on the same basis.</p><p>Old cultures and nations would crash and new would, eventually, be born. <i>That</i> basic story has been told many times in science fiction, and generally with more of a time gap is the basis of a fair bit of fantasy as well&#x2014;<i>The</i> <i>Dying Earth</i> by Vance, for instance, or Alyx Dellamonica&#x2019;s new Stormwrack series that begins with <i>Child of a Hidden Sea</i>. Even the specific removal of higher technology isn&#x2019;t entirely original to me, of course: Steven Boyett&#x2019;s <i>Ariel</i> is a lovely example, though more overtly fantasy. Dragons lairing in the Great Smoky Mountains, anyone?</p><p>But what sort of new cultures would arise in the wake of this <i>particular</i> apocalypse I&#x2019;d come up with? Here I got hints from my subconscious, in the way I usually do when contemplating new books&#x2014;scenes and characters spontaneously appear; one of them was Juniper Mackenzie sitting by a campfire in front of her Romany wagon, and somehow I knew she was a witch (in the strict sense, that is, a Wiccan). Inspiration&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but inspiration is cheap. It&#x2019;s being able to connect the dots that&#x2019;s important.</p><p>The Change is not a random disaster, cataclysmic though it is; it&#x2019;s not an asteroid hitting the earth, and it&#x2019;s not something like nuclear war or ecological collapse that we might do to ourselves. It&#x2019;s precisely tailored to remove certain possibilities. And it involves what is, as far as any human being can tell, a deliberate alteration in the fundamental laws of nature.</p><p>A disaster like that wouldn&#x2019;t just have physical consequences; it would have cultural and ideological-religious ones. Modernism, scientistic-materialist naturalism, would be shot through the head for any but the most fanatical of its devotees, most of whom would perish with the great cities anyway. Technology wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily be reduced to a medieval level; there&#x2019;s nothing to prevent people from using McCormick reapers, water-powered machine tools and antiseptic surgery in areas that preserved some cultural continuity. But the structures of belief based on the scientific and industrial revolutions, at least the more overt and conscious ones, would be dead as the dodo because their basic presumptions would be discredited. The invariability of natural law, for instance.</p><p>Human beings <i>need</i> ideas, though. We don&#x2019;t live in the natural world alone; we live in a world of shared perceptions, assumptions, beliefs. You can&#x2019;t make sense of the raw data of experience without some inner framework of ideas, a theory of how things work. It seemed to me that people in the situation I&#x2019;d postulated would often fall back on the past, on the ways of their ancestors. To a certain extent that would be inevitable, because the material underpinnings of our high-modernist, post-modernist world had been traumatically removed.</p><p>But as a character in an upcoming Change book notes, &#x201c;History cannot be completely undone, even by the Change, nor can the past be truly brought back even if you wear its clothes.&#x201d;</p><p>Groups of survivors&#x2014;often coalescing around some charismatic obsessive leader and his immediate followers&#x2014;would think they were returning to the ways of their ancestors. What they would actually be creating would be <i>new</i> societies based on <i>myths, stories and legends</i> about the past. A group of Wiccans might call themselves a Clan and adopt Gaelic terminology and wear kilts (an eighteenth-century invention by the way), but they wouldn&#x2019;t be much like a group of pre-Christian Celts. A knight of the SCA might contrive to build a kingdom with (ferroconcrete) castles, knights in plate armor made in hydraulic presses and a feudal-monarchical structure, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be much like eleventh-century Normandy. Too much memetic technology has developed in the interim. Isolated ranches in the American West (or estancias in Argentina or stations in Australia) might think they were reverting to a more recent heroic past of bold pioneers, and traumatized English survivors led by Guards officers might think they were reestablishing a myth of Deep England; they&#x2019;d be just as wrong, though more subtly so, beneath the chaps and the smock-frocks.</p><p>This has happened before. The ghost of Rome haunted the Western world for a thousand years and more, with everyone who could trying to appropriate its manna by emulation&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not an accident that we are governed by a Senate from a marble building with domes and columns. That doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re actually Romans, and for that matter the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was neither Holy, Roman, nor an Empire, and a lot of its population weren&#x2019;t Germans.</p><p>And the <i>people</i> who survived the Change would be inescapably modern no matter how disillusioned with the formal ideological superstructure of modernity, often in ways that they weren&#x2019;t conscious of. Though&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what would their children and grandchildren, raised in a world where a mile was once more a long way, be like? Here insert a glyph of authorial hands being rubbed together in glee.</p><p>Throw in the Supernatural (in a Clarkean sense) and you&#x2019;ve got what I decided would be a background as big and varied as the real world. It would have an array of cultures as colorful as anything in pulp fiction&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not least because in some cases they were half-deliberately <i>based</i> on pulp fiction and half-remembered historical novels and bad movies. Why not? Charlemagne&#x2019;s Empire was based on equally bogus memories of Rome. As a bonus, they would usually be more psychologically accessible to modern Western sensibilities than something more genuinely archaic, for the real thing is always alien and often outright repulsive to many.</p><p>They would build their castles from our ruins, and conduct their wars and Quests along the crumbling line of our roads. The ancient past that gradually became half-understood myth&#x2014;was <i>Jurassic Park</i> fiction or fact?&#x2014;would be <i>our present.</i> Instead of sending a single individual or small group through a &#x201c;portal&#x201d; to another world, I could send the <i>whole world</i> to another world.</p><p>I had my own Hyborian Age, my own Middle Earth, but accessible through Google Maps! Including a society founded by a mildly insane Tolkien fangirl who thinks that she and her friends are the D�nedain Rangers amid the Douglas fir and redwoods&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>The rest, as they say, is histories. The novels of the Change, or Emberverse (what comes after <i>Dies the Fire</i> but embers?) have been far and away my most popular work. The setting gives a stage interesting enough and big enough for a large number of stories I&#x2019;ve found fun to write, especially when combined with my cunning trick of giving all the protagonists descendants.</p><p>Herein are some other authors who&#x2019;ve found the world of the Change a fun canvas on which to paint, ranging from seeking fortune and adventure in the ruins of Sydney to Venetian and Greek galleys clashing in the Mediterranean.

He would climb headlong, without pacing himself, always competing with someone or something, and where the trail seemed overlong he would take a short cut via the steepest slope. When you were with him it was forbidden to stop&#x2014;complaining about hunger or the cold was not permitted&#x2014;but you were allowed to sing a good song, especially when caught in a storm or in thick fog. And to whoop whilst flinging yourself down a snowfield.<br> <br>My mother, who had known him since he was a boy, used to say that even then he would wait for nobody, intent as he was on pursuing anyone glimpsed up ahead: it was only a strong pair of legs that could make you desirable in his eyes, and she hinted, laughing, that this was how she had seduced him. Later on, once the uphill race had begun, she preferred to sit in a meadow, or to soak her feet in a stream, or to identify by name the herbs and flowers. At the summit she liked more than anything to gaze at the distant peaks, to reflect on those of her youth, and to remember when she had reached them and with whom&#x2014;while my father at that point was overcome by a kind of disappointment, and just wanted to return home.<br> <br>I think that these were completely opposite reactions to the same shared sense of nostalgia. My parents had migrated to the city in their early thirties, leaving behind the Veneto countryside where my mother had been born, and where my father had been raised as an orphan of the war. Their first mountains, their first love, had been the Dolomites. They would sometimes name them in their conversations, when I was still too young to follow what they were saying but could sense how certain words rang out: special sounds that were charged with additional meaning. The Catinaccio, Sassolungo, Tofane, and the Marmolada. All it took was for my father to utter one of these words, and my mother&#x2019;s eyes would light up.<br> <br>These were the places where they had fallen in love, as even I came to understand after a while: it had been a priest who had taken them there as adolescents, and it was the very same priest who had married them, one autumn morning, in front of the little chapel found at the foot of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. This marriage in the mountains was the foundational myth of our family. Boycotted by my mother&#x2019;s parents, for reasons unknown to me; celebrated with a handful of friends, in anoraks instead of wedding attire, and with a bed in the Auronzo refuge for their first night as husband and wife. The snow was already sparkling on the ledges of Cima Grande. It was a Saturday in October in 1972, the end of the climbing season for that year and for many years to come. The next day they packed their leather climbing boots and plus fours into the car, together with her pregnancy and the contract for his new job, and headed for Milan.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Calmness was not a virtue my father set much store by, but in the city it was more necessary than the lungs needed for climbing. In the seventies in Milan we lived in an apartment building with a panoramic view, above a broad avenue of traffic beneath the asphalt of which, it was said, the Olona river ran. And although it is true that on rainy days the road would become flooded&#x2014;and I would imagine the subterranean river roaring beneath it in the dark, so swollen as to burst from the drains&#x2014;it was that other river coursing with cars, vans, scooters, lorries, buses, and ambulances which seemed always to be in full spate. We lived high up, on the seventh floor, and the two ranks of identical buildings that lined the road amplified the noise. Some nights my father could stand it no longer; he would get out of bed and fling open the window as if he wanted to inveigh against the city, to compel it to be quiet, or to douse it with boiling pitch. He would stand there for a moment looking down, then slip on his coat and go out to walk around.<br> <br>Through those windowpanes we could see a lot of sky. Uniformly white, oblivious to the changing seasons, marked only by the flight of birds. My mother obstinately persisted in cultivating flowers on the small balcony that was blackened by exhaust fumes and mold-stained by the rain. On that balcony, whilst tending her fragile plants, she would tell me about vineyards in August, about the countryside in which she had grown up, about the tobacco leaves hung from the racks in the drying kiln, or about the asparagus that, if it were to remain tender and white, had to be cut before it pierced the soil&#x2019;s surface&#x2014;requiring a rare talent to spot it whilst still underground.<br> <br>Now that sharp eye of hers had become useful in a radically different context. In the Veneto she had been a nurse, but once in Milan she secured a position as a health worker in the &#x201c;Elms&#x201d; district in the western outskirts of the city, in a working-class neighborhood. It was a role that had just been created, together with the equally new family clinic in which she worked providing support for women during pregnancy and following the development of the newborn infants in their first year of life. This was my mother&#x2019;s work, and she liked it. The only thing was that the area where she had been sent to carry it out made it seem more like a mission. Actual elms in these parts were few and far between: the entire toponymy of the neighborhood, with its streets named after alders, spruce, larches, and birch trees, contrasted mockingly with the twelve-story, barracklike housing blocks infested with social ills of every kind. Among my mother&#x2019;s duties was the evaluation of the conditions in which a child was being raised, on visits that affected her deeply for days afterwards. In the most serious cases she was obliged to refer children to the juvenile court. It cost her a great deal of anguish to reach such a point, in addition to receiving a dose of insults and threats, and yet despite this she never doubted that she had reached the right decision. She was not alone in this conviction: the social workers, the educationalists, the schoolteachers were united by a deep-seated solidarity, a feminine sense of collective responsibility towards these children.<br> <br>My father on the other hand had always been a loner. He worked as a chemist in a factory&#x2014;with a ten-thousand-strong workforce, constantly subject to strike action and sackings&#x2014;and whatever had taken place in there, he would return home in the evening full of anger. At suppertime he would stare in silence at the TV news, gripping his cutlery in midair, as if he expected at any moment the outbreak of another world war; and he would curse to himself at the news of every murder victim, every governmental crisis, every hike in the price of oil, every bombing by unidentified terrorists. With the few colleagues he would invite home he discussed almost exclusively political issues, and always ended up in an argument. He would cast himself as anticommunist with communists, as a radical with Catholics, as a freethinker with anyone who presumed to confine him in a church or on a list of party members. But these were not times during which you could escape all allegiance, and after a while my father&#x2019;s workmates stopped coming round. Yet he continued to go to work as if he were climbing every morning into the trenches. He continued not to sleep at night, to take things too much to heart, to wear earplugs and take pills for his headaches, to explode in violent fits of rage&#x2014;at which point my mother would spring into action, since along with her marital duties she had also assumed the role of pacifying him, of muffling the blows in the fight between my father and the world.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>At home they still spoke the dialect of the Veneto. To my ears it sounded like a secret language that they shared, the echo of a mysterious previous life. A remnant of the past, just like the three photographs my mother had displayed on a small table in the entrance hall. I would often stop to look at them. The first was a portrait of her parents in Venice, during the only trip they had ever taken, a gift from my grandfather to my grandmother to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary. In the second her entire family had posed for the camera during the grape harvest: my grandparents sat at the center of the group, three girls and a young man standing around them, the baskets filled with grapes in the courtyard of the barn. In the third my grandparents&#x2019; only male offspring, my uncle, smiled together with my father next to a summit cross, dressed in mountaineering gear and with a rope wound round his shoulder. My uncle had died young, and that was why I bore his name, though I was called Pietro and he was Piero, in our family lexicon. And yet of all these people I had known none. I was never taken to visit them, nor did they ever turn up for a visit in Milan. A few times a year my mother would take a train of a Saturday morning, and come back Sunday evening a little sadder than she&#x2019;d left. Then she would get over it and life would continue. There was too much to be done, and too many people to care for, to indulge in melancholy.<br> <br>But that past had a way of leaping out at you when you least expected it. Long car journeys were necessary to take me to school, my mother to the clinic, and my father to the factory, and on certain mornings she would sing an old song. She would begin the first verse in the traffic, and soon after we would join in. These songs were set in the mountains during the Great War: &#x201c;The Troop Train,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Sugana Valley,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Captain&#x2019;s Testament.&#x201d; They told stories that I, too, now knew by heart: twenty-seven had departed for the front, and only five had returned. Down there on the battlefield of the Piave stood a cross for a mother who would sooner or later come in search of it. Far away a betrothed waited, sighing, then tired of waiting and married another&#x2014;the dying man would send her a kiss, and ask for a flower in return. I understood from the words of dialect in these songs that my parents had carried them from their previous life, but I also sensed something different and strange&#x2014;that is to say that these songs also spoke directly about the two of them, who knows how. I mean about the two of them specifically: how else to explain the degree of emotion that their voices so clearly betrayed?<br> <br>Then on certain rare windy days, in autumn or spring, at the end of Milanese streets, the mountains would appear. It would happen after a bend in the road, above an overpass, suddenly, and the gaze of both my parents would immediately switch there, without one needing to point out anything to the other. The peaks were white, the sky a rare blue, the sensation as of a miracle. Down below, where we lived, were factories in turmoil, overcrowded social housing, riots in the piazza, abused children, teenage mothers: up there, the snow. My mother would ask then which mountains were in view, and my father would look around as if navigating the urban geography with a compass. Which avenue is this: Monza, Zara? Then it must be La Grigna, he would say, having thought about it a bit. Yes, I&#x2019;m sure that it is really her. I remembered the story well: La Grigna was a most beautiful and cruel warrior who had killed with her arrows the knights who climbed to declare their love for her&#x2014;so God had punished her by turning her into a mountain. And now she was there, through the windscreen, allowing herself to be admired by the three of us, each one with a different, silent thought. Then the lights changed, a pedestrian would run across, someone sounded the horn, my father would tell them where to get off and change gear furiously, accelerating away from that moment of grace.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The end of the seventies arrived, and while Milan was burning the two of them put on their climbing boots again. They did not head east, from where they had come, but west, as if continuing their flight, towards the Ossola, the Valsesia, the Val d&#x2019;Aosta; towards mountains that were still higher and more severe. My mother would later tell me that at first she had been overcome by an unexpected feeling of oppression. Compared to the gentle contours of the Veneto and the Trentino these western valleys seemed narrow, dark, enclosed like gorges; the rock was damp and black, streams and waterfalls plunging down from everywhere. So much water, she thought. It must rain a lot here. She had not realized that all of that water originated in an exceptional source, nor that she and my father were heading straight for it. They climbed up one of the valleys until they were high enough to emerge again into sunlight: from there the landscape suddenly opened up, and before their eyes stood Monte Rosa. An Arctic world, a permanent winter, looming over the summer pastures. It frightened my mother. But my father would say that for him it had been like discovering a new scale of grandeur: like arriving from the mountains of men to find yourself in the mountains of giants. And naturally he fell in love with them at first sight.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know exactly where they were on that day. Whether it was Macugnaga, Alagna, Gressoney, Ayas. At that time we would holiday in a different place each year, following my father on his restless wandering all around the mountain that had conquered him. Better than the valleys I remember the houses in which we stayed, if you could call them houses: we would rent a bungalow in a campsite, or a room in a hostel, and stay there for a couple of weeks. There was never enough room to make these places homely, or time enough to become attached to anything, but my father did not care for or even notice such things.<br> <br>As soon as we arrived he would get changed&#x2014;take from his bag the checked shirt, the corduroy trousers, the woolen jumper&#x2014;and, wearing these old clothes again, he became a different man. He would spend the short vacation exploring the mountain paths, leaving early in the morning and returning in the evening, or even the next day&#x2014;covered in dust, burnt by the sun, tired and happy. Over supper he would talk of the chamois and the Alpine ibexes, of nights spent bivouacked, of starlit skies, of snow that at such altitude fell even in August, and when he was most happy he would end by saying: I really wish that you could have been there with me.<br> <br>The fact of the matter is that my mother refused to climb the glacier. She harbored an irrational and unshakable fear of it: she used to say that, as far as she was concerned, the mountain ended at three thousand meters, the altitude, that is, of her own range, the Dolomites. She preferred two thousand meters to three&#x2014;the meadows, rivers, woods&#x2014;and deeply loved one thousand too, the life there of those villages of wood and stone. When my father was away she liked to go for walks with me, to drink a coffee in the square, to sit in a meadow and read to me from a book, to exchange a few words with a passerby. She reluctantly endured our constant changes of place. She often pleaded with my father that she would prefer a house that she could make her own, and a village to return to, and he would tell her that there wasn&#x2019;t enough money for another rent, in addition to that of the apartment in Milan. But she managed to negotiate with him a budget that was within their means, and finally he allowed her to begin searching for a place of our own.<br> <br>In the evenings, as soon as the remains of supper had been cleared away, my father would unfold a map onto the table an...</p><h2>The Cult of Elizabeth: Elizabethan Portraiture and Pageantry</h2><p>No other woman in world history has been of such compulsive interest as Elizabeth Tudor. While the rest of the 16th-century Europe was subject to the bloodshed of religious war, Tudor peace brought England its great flowering of the arts. Central to that flowering was the enigmatic legend of the Queen herself, a myth deliberately created and sustained over four decades by public spectacle and courtly chivalry, by private sonnet and official oration.</p><p>Sir Roy Strong is well-known as an historian and garden writer, lecturer, critic, columnist and regular contributor to both radio and television. He was Director of the National Portrait Gallery from 1967-73 and of the V&amp;A from 1974-87. In 1980 he was awarded the prestigious Shakespeare Prize by the FVS Foundation of Hamburg in recognition of his contribution to the arts in the UK. He has published a number of highly acclaimed books and his recent publications include THE STORY OF BRITAIN, THE SPIRIT OF BRITAIN, A COUNTRY LIFE, FEAST, CORONATION, THE LASKETT and his own diaries. He lives in Herefordshire.Among the manifold lessons history may teach is the skillful use of public relations&#x2014;as used, for example, in the court of Elizabeth I. Four centuries ago, the sovereign&#x2019;s flaks and spinmeisters did a job, unmatched since, in the promotion of the cult of Gloriana (i.e., Elizabeth), celebrated as the maiden ruler for some 45 years during her life (and a long time thereafter). No longer would the Catholic Virgin Mary reign in England; the Protestant Virgin Queen would be venerated in her place. British art historian Strong&#x2019;s (Elizabeth R, 1971, etc.) study, first published in Britain a generation ago and now available in the US as an elegant paperback, elucidates Elizabethan propaganda as it was practiced through the masterful use of poesy, pictures, and pageants&#x2014;all designed to enhance the image of the Tudor queen. Familiar Elizabethan pictures are parsed to fix the scene and time. First, the depiction of the social event of 1600 in Peake&#x2019;s <i>Procession Picture<i> is used by Strong to distinguish and describe various influential nobles who are shown accompanying Her Majesty. Studying Hilliard&#x2019;s emblematic <i>Young Man Amongst Roses<i>, he identifies the romantic youth who sports the nascent mustache as none other than Essex himself. Then Sir Henry Unton&#x2019;s <i>Memorial Picture<i> is deconstructed to sketch the life of a representative courtier. The brief guide to the world of Gloriana continues with descriptions of f�tes and pageants. Accession Day festivities, commemorating Her Majesty&#x2019;s achievement of the throne, were marked by bells, bonfires, bombast, and tournaments. Masques and jousts and parades by the Garter Knights enhanced the secular mythology of majestic chivalry. Puissant PR was indeed at work, but maybe the Age of Elizabeth was, in its way, quite some time after all. Surely it was a time as remarkable and as bizarre as our own.Elizabeth was complex and her character often obscure. Her cult was a deliberate creation, says Strong, and his presentation is convincing, scholarly, and sophisticated. Knowledge of Latin helpful, but not essential.

In a time before air travel or radio, on the brink of a revolution in photography and filmmaking, Burton Holmes (1870-1958) set upon a lifelong journey to bring the world home. From the grand boulevards of Paris to China&#39;s Great Wall, from the first modern Olympics in Athens to the 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius, Holmes delighted in finding ?the beautiful way around the world? and made a career of sharing his stories, photographs, and films with audiences across America. As a young man, Holmes was mentored by John L. Stoddard, a pioneer of the U.S. travel lecture circuit, who passed on his well-established mantle when he retired. Holmes roamed the globe throughout the summer and traversed the United States all winter, transforming the staid lecture tradition into an entertaining show. He coined the term ?Travelogue? in 1904 to advertise his unique performance and thrilled audiences with two-hour sets of stories timed to projections of hand-painted glass-lantern slides and some of the first &#34;&#34;moving pictures.&#34;&#34; Paris, Peking, Dehli, Dubrovnick, Moscow, Manila, Jakarta, Jerusalem: Burton Holmes was there. He visited every continent and nearly every country on the planet, shooting over 30,000 photographs and nearly 500,000 feet of film. This book represents the best of the Holmes archive, brimming with brilliant color photographs not published in decades. A rare window on the world of 100 years ago, Burton Holmes Travelogues will transport you to a time that has all but evaporated, and inspire you to strike out on a journey of your own.

"May well establish Ms. Hayden as the Roger Tory Peterson of Sprawl." &#x2015;<em>New York Times</em><br></strong></p> Duck, ruburb, tower farm, big box, and pig-in-a-python are among the dozens of zany terms invented by real estate developers and designers today to characterize land-use practices and the physical elements of sprawl. Sprawl in the environment, based on the metaphor of a person spread out, is hard to define. This concise book engages its meaning, explains common building patterns, and illustrates the visual culture of sprawl. Seventy-five stunning color aerial photographs, each paired with a definition, convey the impact of excessive development. This "engagingly organized and splendidly photographed" (<em>Wall Street Journal</em>) book provides the verbal and visual vocabulary needed by professionals, public officials, and citizens to critique uncontrolled growth in the American landscape. 75 color illustrations</p><p>Dolores Hayden, professor of architecture and American studies at Yale, writes about the politics of design.A mere glance through the pages of this book offers a quick education about the excesses of the recently built environment. By its very nature, sprawl is hard to identify and track, but Hayden, a Yale professor of architecture and American studies, provides a combination of informed but breezy text and 75 large, crisp color images that greatly simplify the task of "decoding everyday American landscapes." Organized alphabetically, with a big two-page spread for each entry, the book moves from "alligator" (an investment that "eats" cash flow, represented here by the vast and ghostly grid of an unbuilt New Mexico suburb) to "zoomburb" (a suburb on steroids, illustrated here by Arizona's spiraling Sun City). Along the way, the reader comes to the depressing understanding that troubling phenomena one might have thought strictly local or temporary&#x2014;for instance, houses where the garage is the dominant projecting feature&#x2014;are common enough to have acquired names, in this case "snout house." But more than a set of colorful terms&#x2014;all of which, from "ball pork" to "parsley round the pig" are carefully sourced&#x2014;this book is a concise guide to not only sprawl itself but to the powerful political and financial forces that sustain it. If the book has one problematic aspect, it is that Wark's aerial photographs are often so vividly beautiful that they risk aestheticizing their often grim subjects&#x2014;but their seductive quality serves to draw the viewer into Hayden's passionately sustained argument. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The theory defines special operations forces as those forces organized to combat irregulars and irregular warfare as war fought by institutionally weak combatants, as opposed to conventional warfare between institutionally strong states. A study of the evolution of irregular warfare and its theoretical underpinnings leads to five characteristics that differentiate it from conventional warfare. These characteristics define an opaque form of warfare, requiring physical, cognitive, and moral access to successfully pursue strategic objectives. The theory then proposes a set of tenets to guide operational planners and leaders in arranging SOF tactical actions to achieve a strategic objective.</p><p></p><h2>Fishing Dry Flies: Surface Presentations for Trout in Streams (The Complete Fly Fisherman)</h2><p>-Offers an in-depth look at surface-fishing presentations.</p><p>The editors of Creative Publishing international have created dozens of best-selling titles in the fields of hunting, fishing, home repair, home improvement, home decor, and landscaping.</p><h2>The Interfaith Alternative: Embracing Spiritual Diversity</h2><p><p>Whatever your spiritual path, chances are that the primary tenets of your faith include universal love, acceptance, and compassion.

A. B. van Buitenen. The present volume, edited by myself and Rohit Dalvi, is basically a 2nd edition of the earlier work. Some changes and additions have been made in the selections from the Upaniads and new materials from Srihara have been added to the selections from the major Advaitic philosophers. In the preface to the first edition we noted that the purpose of this book is to help make possible a study of Advaita Vedanta in its classical form as this great tradition of thought actually functioned in Indian culture and as this tradition represents distinctive philosophical achievements. We are concerned in short to understand Advaita Vedanta both in terms of cultural history and philosophy. We are presenting translations of selections from the major Sanskrit writings of some of the most important Advaitic thinkers, together with the appropriate background materials. We have not included in this work any material from the neo-Vedanta that has developed in India in recent decades (e.g., Vivekananda, Aurobindo, Radhakrishnan) as the literature of this movement, having been written in English, is readily accessible. In a collaboration of this sort the authors, while standing behind the entire work, have naturally divided it into areas of special individual responsibility. Van Buitenen has worked primarily with chapters 1&#x2013;4, and Deutsch with chapters 5&#x2013;21. The authors are extremely grateful to the publishers of the selected Sanskrit translations for their permission to use material previously published by them.Eliot Deutsch is an eminent philosopher, teacher, and writer. He has made important contributions to the understanding and appreciation of Eastern philosophies in the West through his many works on comparative philosophy and comparative aesthetics. The author of 15 books, Deutsch is Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Department of Philosophy, University of Hawaii. He has also written over 85 articles and reviews for professional journals. His works have been translated into French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, highlighting his contributions to transcultural understanding.</p><h2>Judgment Call Large Print : A Brady Novel of Suspense (Joanna Brady) (Joanna Brady Mysteries, 15)</h2><p><p>The <em>New York Times</em> bestselling master of mystery and suspense, J.A.

These individuals, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, left their jobs in the abortion industry after experiencing a change of heart. They have come forward with their stories, not for fame or notoriety, but to shed light on the reality of abortion. They want their stories to change the lives of others for the better.</p><p>These stories are difficult to read, because an abortion is an act of violence, harming not only the obvious victim&#x2015;the unborn child-- but also the mother, the father, the doctor, and everyone else involved. But these stories also offer hope, for they show that anyone, no matter what part the person has played in an abortion, can start anew, can make amends for past mistakes. They demonstrate that the first step on that journey is telling the truth, as these courageous individuals do in these pages.</p><p>"Those of us that have worked in the abortion industry all live with a constant burden. We can't let our burden slide off of our shoulders; it is what keeps us on fire. It reminds us of why we fight so hard. We have seen death and evil in a way that most haven't&#x2015;and we participated. But we are forgiven. He who has been forgiven much, loves much. And we love a lot.

Years ago, I walked away from a Stanford Ph.D. and an academic position when I told the truth about forced abortions in China. The women in this book did the same thing.

Among them are her great-aunt Margot Asquith, married to the Prime Minister, her reclusive uncle Stephan, and her half-brother Colin who built a palace in the Caribbean. She includes no index or bibliography, but does provide a family tree. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>The best memoirs are lit by far more than the actual: ambivalence, too, comes into painful play. And as she reveals in <i>Strangers</i>, Emma Tennant has long seen herself as a member of her nouvelle aristocratic tribe and yet "no such thing." Her astonishing family reverie opens on August 12, 1912--25 years before she was born--but her account of a long-ago picnic, in Scottish "fields where imagined rabbits ran," brings her forebears to instant if pinioned life. An uncle surveys the estates he will eventually inherit, thanks to the Great War, though as third son he is yet to know this. A great-aunt (Prime Minister Asquith's wife, no less) refines her contempt for her sister-in-law, who already "lives in a climate of fears and premonitions." Inheritance and expectation, it is clear, are a concern for all. But even on the "Glorious Twelfth," the children are more rebellious than the adult aristos might like--as the shadows in the family photo reveal: <blockquote>It's clear the photographer has had difficulty with them, because the land slopes away at this point from the party on the rug, and the children all appear to have large feet--something Pamela's daughter Clarissa--Clare--will be angry about right up to the day she dies. The children, although told by their father to keep absolutely still, are slightly out of focus, as if they were growing so fast the camera was unable to capture them...</blockquote> Tennant's virtuoso beginning is far more than a memory-picture: here as throughout she elegantly dips in out and of each person's thoughts and even dreams, excavating obsessions and unearthing the ends to which several will come. (Not for nothing did Karl Miller term <i>Strangers</i> her "best novel to date" in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> in 1998.)<p> Much later, Tennant refers to "the strange yet known monsters who are my family," but her memoir is not just a pageant of eccentrics and aesthetes. (Readers will now be most familiar with her Uncle Stephen, famously beautiful in his youth--even TB only improves his looks--and infamously pathetic in his old age.) As Tennant moves from 1912 to 1986--from pheasant shoots to s�ances in which mothers and servant lovers try to contact dead soldiers to an encounter with a smiling, dying nephew--she tries desperately to distinguish between truth and fantasy (others' and her own). <i>Strangers</i> is never straightforward, its very intricacies the author's attempts to tease out, and tease her way out of, her family's "fatal pattern"--one of thwarted love and destructive unhappiness. Visiting Stephen in 1965, Tennant realizes that "everything here is devoted to murdering memory and keeping it intact at the same time." In <i>Strangers</i> her own aim--though often levitated by wit and weirdness--is even more devastating. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><p>Emma Tennant was born in London and spent her childhood in Scotland. Her previous novels include The Bad Sister, Faustine, and Pemberley. She has three grown children and lives in London.</p></p><h2>The Summoning (The Darkest Powers, Book 1)</h2><p>After years of frequent moves following her mother&#x2019;s death, Chloe Saunders&#x2019;s life is finally settling down.

Today she continues to spin tales of ghosts and demons and werewolves while safely locked in her basement writing-dungeon.Grade 6 Up&#x2014;A well-written opening to a paranormal series. Chloe, 15, has the ability to see dead people, but before she can figure out what is happening, she has a breakdown, is diagnosed with schizophrenia, and placed in a group home. She befriends some of the teens at Lyle House and tries to accept her treatment. However, two of her more mysterious housemates suggest that maybe she isn't crazy. Derek tells her to look up necromancy on the Internet, and she finds out that it's the ability to communicate with the spirits of the dead. He appears to have superstrength, and his foster brother has magical powers. Chloe's roommate, who causes things to fly around the room when she becomes angry, is taken away to a hospital and never heard from again. When she returns in Chloe's visions, Chloe suspects foul play, a misgiving confirmed when the dead speak to her again and reveal that they were "supernaturals" who were experimented on, killed, and buried in the home's basement many years before. Together with her new friends, Chloe escapes Lyle House, only to be betrayed. This suspenseful novel sets up a secret underworld where some people support and help supernaturals, while others persecute them. Armstrong combines bits of horror, teen relationships, and a dash of mystery to create a page-turner. Readers will look forward to the next installment.&#x2014;<i>Corinda J.

Does this prodigious flow of information have significance for anyone except the tiny percentage of people who have significant holdings of stocks or bonds? And if it does, can non-specialists ever hope to understand what the markets are up to? To these questions Wall Street answers an emphatic yes. Its author Doug Henwood is a notorious scourge of the stock exchange in the pages of his acerbic publication Left Business Observer. The Newsletter has received wide acclamation from J.K. Galbraith, among others, and occasional less favorable comment. Norman Pearlstine, then executive editor of the Wall Street Journal, lamented, `You are scum ... it&#x2019;s tragic that you exist.&#x2019; With compelling clarity, Henwood dissects the world&#x2019;s greatest financial center, laying open the intricacies of how, and for whom, the market works. The Wall Street which emerges is not a pretty sight. Hidden from public view, the markets are poorly regulated, badly managed, chronically myopic and often corrupt. And though, as Henwood reveals, their activity contributes almost nothing to the real economy where goods are made and jobs created, they nevertheless wield enormous power. With over a trillion dollars a day crossing the wires between the world&#x2019;s banks, Wall Street and its sister financial centers don&#x2019;t just influence government, effectively they are the government.</p><p>Doug Henwood is a journalist who has contributed frequently to the Nation and broadcasts a weekly radio show covering economics and politics on New York&#39;s WBAI. He is the author of The State of the USA Atlas and editor of the newsletter Left Business Observer.In this "down and dirty" diatribe about American finance, journalist and New York radio personality Henwood makes no attempt at a balanced portrayal of Wall Street. He aims to "embarrass official wisdom" and expose the financial world's weaknesses, perhaps too gloatingly. Intemperate phrasing abounds, e.g., "real estate is based on milking wealth from land and tenants." Admittedly, Henwood flails at both the Left and the Right, and he doesn't hide his biases, but he lovingly quotes Keynes and Marx a little too often. Henwood doesn't claim to be offering any practical investment advice; nor does he present any solutions to the problems against which he fulminates. The result is a difficult, divisive, unpleasant, querulous, and uninstructive book that larger business collections might tolerate.?Alexander Wenner, Indiana Univ.

This new 4th Edition has been undated significantly beyond the 3rd. The author went back to almost all canyons, or at least to the trailheads, to check out the mile post markers, etc. Also, about half a dozen less-interesting canyons or hikes from the 3rd Edition were eliminated; while about a dozen new &amp; more challenging hikes have been added, plus another 32 pages. This 4th edition contains 320 pages and 191 fotographs, about 90 of which are new. <p> The new canyons are from scattered locations in southern Utah, primarily in Zion National Park, and the Escalante River, San Rafael Swell &amp; Robbers Roost country, along with major updates on slot canyons on the Navajo Nation. Other big changes to this edition are the addition of about a dozen new technical slot canyons; that is, canyons where you need ropes and rappelling gear to get through. This adds another dimension to excitement and challenge, and opens many new hiking areas previously closed to many of us. All these technical canyons are now either bolted-up, or have slings or webbing around boulders, making them ready for rappelling. </p><p> The general direction for this book, is toward slot canyons, which everybody likes; but it retains easy &amp; fun hikes to canyons with Anasazi ruins, another favorite. So if you're looking for petroglyphs or pictographs, and cliff dwellings or ruins, which some people try their best to hide, then this is your book. In the back of this book is a section listing the Best Hikes, including for the most part Slot Canyons, then best hikes to see Indian ruins, and Native American rock arts sites.

The once rebellious teen has grown into a six-foot-tall, motorcycle-riding jaw-dropper, with an impressive knowledge of and ability to perform spells. The only problem is, she's having a hard time convincing her adoptive parents, Paige and Lucas, to take her seriously as an adult. She's working as the research assistant at the detective agency they founded, and when they take off on a romantic vacation alone, leaving her in charge, Savannah finds herself itching for a case to call her own. (She's also itching for Adam, her longtime friend and colleague, to see her as more than just a little girl, but that's another matter.) <br><br> Suddenly, Savannah gets the chance she's been waiting for: Recruited by another supernatural detective, she travels to Columbus, Washington, a small, dying town. Two troubled young women have been found in an abandoned warehouse, murdered. Now a third woman's dead, and on closer inspection small details point to darker forces at play. Savannah feels certain she can handle the case, but with signs of supernatural activity appearing at every turn, things quickly become more serious- and far more dangerous-than she realizes.</p><p>Kelley Armstrong lives in rural southwestern Canada with her husband and three children.<p> </p><p> </p><p>Table of Contents</p><p>Title Page</p><p>Copyright Page</p><p>Dedication</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>one</p><p>two</p><p>three</p><p>four</p><p>five</p><p>six</p><p>seven</p><p>eight</p><p>nine</p><p>ten</p><p>eleven</p><p>twelve</p><p>thirteen</p><p>fourteen</p><p>fifteen</p><p>sixteen</p><p>seventeen</p><p>eighteen</p><p>nineteen</p><p>twenty</p><p>twenty-one</p><p>twenty-two</p><p>twenty-three</p><p>twenty-four</p><p>twenty-five</p><p>twenty-six</p><p>twenty-seven</p><p>twenty-eight</p><p>twenty-nine</p><p>thirty</p><p>thirty-one</p><p>thirty-two</p><p>thirty-three</p><p>thirty-four</p><p>thirty-five</p><p>thirty-six</p><p>thirty-seven</p><p>thirty-eight</p><p>thirty-nine</p><p>forty</p><p>forty-one</p><p>forty-two</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>BOOKS BY KELLEY ARMSTRONG</b></p><p>The Otherworld Series</p><p><i>Bitten</i> <br><i>Stolen</i> <br><i>Dime Store Magic</i> <br><i>Industrial Magic</i> <br><i>Haunted</i> <br><i>Broken</i> <br><i>No Humans Involved</i> <br><i>Personal Demon</i> <br><i>Living with the Dead</i> <br><i>Frostbitten</i> <br><i>Waking the Witch</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Nadia Stafford Series</p><p><i>Exit Strategy</i> <br><i>Made to Be Broken</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Darkest Powers Series</p><p><i>The Summoning</i> <br><i>The Awakening</i> <br><i>The Reckoning</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Collections</p><p><i>Men of the Otherworld</i> <br><i>Tales of the Otherworld</i></p><p>DUTTON</p><p>Published by Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</p><p>375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, U.S.A.</p><p>Penguin Group (Canada), 90 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, Ontario M4P 2Y3, Canada (a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc.); Penguin Books Ltd, 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England; Penguin Ireland, 25 St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green, Dublin 2, Ireland (a division of Penguin Books Ltd); Penguin Group (Australia), 250 Camberwell Road, Camberwell, Victoria 3124, Australia (a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty Ltd); Penguin Books India Pvt Ltd, 11 Community Centre, Panchsheel Park, New Delhi - 110 017, India; Penguin Group (NZ), 67 Apollo Drive, Rosedale, North Shore 0632, New Zealand (a division of Pearson New Zealand Ltd); Penguin Books (South Africa) (Pty) Ltd, 24 Sturdee Avenue, Rosebank, Johannesburg 2196, South Africa</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Penguin Books Ltd, Registered Offices: 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England <br>Published by Dutton, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>First printing, August 2010</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>Copyright � 2010 by K.L.A.

Thanks, guys!</p><p><b>prologue</b></p><p><b>F</b>or the first time since Claire Kennedy died last week, there wasn&#x2019;t a police officer guarding the site of her murder.</p><p>Kayla peered out from behind the boarded-up beauty salon. Seeing no one, she hoisted her backpack and set out, kicking stones, her gaze fixed on the ground. She was careful to walk slowly. If you ran, grown-ups paid attention. Kayla hated it when they paid attention. She liked being invisible.</p><p>Until her mom was murdered last year, Kayla had always been invisible. But now it wasn&#x2019;t just the other kids who whispered behind her back, calling her weird or&#x2014;in grown-up language&#x2014;&#x201c;an odd little thing.&#x201d; Adults did, too. It wouldn&#x2019;t help if they found her sneaking into the place where her mom had been murdered.</p><p>Kayla knew the rear door would be locked. She had lock picks from her Junior Detective kit, but they were just toys. She knew a way in, though. A boarded-up window on the first floor with a gap big enough for a nine-year-old to squeeze through. Concrete blocks scattered behind the building made a good stepladder.</p><p>She pushed her backpack in first. It hit the floor with a thump.</p><p>As she hoisted herself through the window, she avoided the broken glass she&#x2019;d cut herself on last time. Grandma had flipped out and taken her to the clinic. Grandma was like that. She worried a lot. After Mom died, Kayla thought Grandma would have less to worry about. No such luck.</p><p>She dropped to the floor and rummaged in her backpack for her flashlight. Plastic, of course. She&#x2019;d considered asking Grandma for a real one for her birthday, but hadn&#x2019;t figured out yet how to explain why she needed it.</p><p>Kayla shone the flashlight around. Empty. No, that was the wrong word. The building was only empty of <i>people.</i> Abandoned.</p><p>There was tons of crap here, all of it dirty and old and broken, but Kayla barely needed the flashlight to get where she was going. She&#x2019;d been here five times since her mom had died. She&#x2019;d recorded every visit in her notebook. There hadn&#x2019;t been much to see, though. By the time she thought of coming, the police had cleared the place out.</p><p>This time it would be different. If Claire Kennedy had been killed here just over a week ago, there had to be a connection to the murder of her mother and her mother&#x2019;s best friend. There just had to be.</p><p>She opened the basement door and shone her light into blackness. She went down one step, then stopped, working up her nerve as she always did, before shutting the door and letting the darkness of the basement envelop her, her plastic flashlight barely strong enough to cast a pale, distant circle.</p><p>Halfway down the stairs, she heard the thump of a door shutting above. An officer back on duty? That was okay. He&#x2019;d peek inside the main floor, assure himself all was clear, then sit outside in his pickup. Kayla knew the routine.</p><p>Still she listened for a minute. When no more noises came, she resumed her descent. Down into the basement, where the chill was enough to make her wish she&#x2019;d brought her jacket. Lissa would say it was the chill of death.</p><p>Lissa talked like that. When Kayla confided that she came here, her friend&#x2019;s eyes had gone round and she&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Are you trying to contact her ghost?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whose ghost?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s, dummy. If you could talk to her, she could tell you who killed her.&#x201d;</p><p>Kayla thought that was silly, but she didn&#x2019;t say so. Lissa was the only friend she had.</p><p>It was just a dark, cold, smelly basement. Where her mom had died. And no one knew who&#x2019;d done it or why. That&#x2019;s why Kayla kept coming back. To find out what had happened to her mom. And to Brandi, though really she didn&#x2019;t much care what had happened to Brandi. But Grandma would say she shouldn&#x2019;t think like that. She did want to find out what happened to Claire Kennedy, though. She hadn&#x2019;t really known Claire&#x2014;she was one of the girls from the cookie place&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d seen her around town a few times, and she&#x2019;d seemed nice, always smiling and waving, even though they&#x2019;d never met.</p><p>From the bottom of the basement stairs, Kayla picked her way around piles of junk until she saw the yellow crime-scene tape wrapped around a pillar, the broken end trailing across the floor.</p><p>She stopped. It was exactly the same spot where her mother&#x2019;s and Brandi&#x2019;s bodies had been found. She shivered and maybe it wasn&#x2019;t the cold this time, but she told herself it was.</p><p>She crept forward. There was blood on the cement floor. The spot wasn&#x2019;t very big, not like the big stains she could still see, almost hidden under a layer of dust.</p><p>She shone the flashlight on those old blood stains and, for a second, she could see her mother lying there, her eyes open, her&#x2014;</p><p>Kayla shook her head sharply and swung the beam away. She wasn&#x2019;t here to think about her mother. She was here to find out who killed her. And she didn&#x2019;t need ghosts for that. She needed science.</p><p>She took her backpack off and unzipped it. Inside was her Junior Detective kit. She had a camera, too. A real one. It was on her mom&#x2019;s old cell phone, which Grandma let her keep for emergencies. She took it out for a picture of the blood. Blood stains were important. They could tell you&#x2014;</p><p>A creak overhead. Kayla froze. Then she shook her head. Just a noisy old building. She aimed the flashlight with one hand, holding the cell with the other&#x2014;</p><p>This time footsteps sounded above her, crossing the first floor, the distinct <i>thump-thump</i> of someone walking.</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>Just the police officer. Or maybe Chief Bruyn, come back to check something. Or someone from town, also trying to sneak a peek at the crime scene.</p><p>But what if it was someone else?</p><p>Kayla had read every book in the library on murder investigations. One line came back to her now. <i>The killer may return to the scene of the crime.</i></p><p>It seemed crazy to come back after you&#x2019;d gotten away, but Kayla trusted the books and, listening to those footsteps, her heart hammered.</p><p>Then it hit her. If this <i>was</i> the killer, maybe she really could solve her mother&#x2019;s death. All she had to do was hide and see who showed up.</p><p>A <i>click</i> from upstairs&#x2014;the basement door opening.</p><p>Kayla turned off her flashlight and tucked herself into the shadows beside the old furnace.</p><p><b>one</b></p><p><b>F</b>or five years, I&#x2019;d toiled as executive assistant slave to Lucas and Paige and now, finally, I was in charge. For the next week anyway.</p><p>The plaque still read Cortez-Winterbourne Investigations, but that could be easily changed with the deft use of an energy bolt spell. Levine Investigations rolled off the tongue so much more easily. At one time, I would have done it, if only as a joke, but there are things you can get away with at sixteen that just don&#x2019;t fly at twenty-one.</p><p>I used my key card, then crept through the lobby, trying to squelch the click of my heels.</p><p>&#x201c;Savannah!&#x201d; a voice chirped behind me. &#x201c;I thought I heard you come in.&#x201d;</p><p>I started a cover spell, but Tina had already spotted me. I considered a knockback spell&#x2014;make her trip and give me time to escape. But that would, sadly, not be a good way to launch my week playing a responsible adult.</p><p>When Paige said we were getting an accountant for a tenant, I&#x2019;d thought, <i>Great, someone nice and quiet.</i> That was the stereotype, but apparently, no one had told Tina.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad I caught you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost ten and no one&#x2019;s in the office yet.&#x201d;</p><p>It was 9:14.</p><p>&#x201c;There was a man here looking for Lucas,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;I called upstairs and the phone rang and rang. Did he and Paige leave on vacation already? I know Adam is at a conference. In Spokane, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;</p><p>I made a noncommittal noise. Tina might be human, but she had a supernatural sense for snooping. Adam said we should hire her. I threatened to give her his home address and that shut him up.</p><p>&#x201c;I hate to tell you kids how to run your business, but you really need to have someone up there during business hours. It&#x2019;s no wonder you have hardly any clients. You need a full-time receptionist.&#x201d; She patted my arm. &#x201c;Yes, I know, dear, you&#x2019;re the receptionist, but you&#x2019;re always flitting off, doing god-knows-what. I could&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my cell phone&#x2019;s vibrating,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;Could be a client. I&#x2019;ll talk to Paige about drop-ins.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no bother, dear. I wanted to speak to you anyway. I think I have a job for you.&#x201d; Tina lowered her voice, though we were the only ones in the lobby. &#x201c;I started dating this man. A widower I met online.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you want me to run a background check? Good idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no. A man has the right to his privacy. It&#x2019;s just ... Well, I was watching this show on private investigators, about a firm of women hired by other women to test their mate&#x2019;s loyalty.&#x201d;</p><p>It took me a second to catch her drift. &#x201c;You want me to try to seduce your boyfriend?&#x201d;</p><p>Her lips pursed. &#x201c;Certainly not. Just get dolled up, talk to him, flirt with him, and see whether he&#x2019;ll flirt back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m probably half his age. I&#x2019;d be worried if he <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> flirt back.&#x201d;</p><p>A muffled snort made me glance down the hall. A guy a couple of years older than me leaned out of the stairwell doorway. Light hair just past his collar, denim jacket, boots, and a pair of snug-fitting worn blue jeans. He lifted a finger to his lips, shushing me, and I tried not to stare even if he was definitely stare-worthy.</p><p>I turned back to Tina. &#x201c;That guy who wanted to speak to Lucas. Did you let him in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly not.&#x201d; She lowered her voice. &#x201c;He looked a little dodgy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was he in his midtwenties? Dark blond hair? Looks like he lost contact with his razor a few days ago?&#x201d;</p><p>The guy arched his brows, mock-indignant.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; Tina said. &#x201c;Now about my job offer ...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Spend the money on a shopping spree at Victoria&#x2019;s Secret and make sure he&#x2019;s too exhausted to look at twenty-year-olds.&#x201d;</p><p>Before she recovered from that suggestion, I took off.</p><p>The guy waited until she was safely in her office, then strolled to meet me.</p><p>&#x201c;Dodgy?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the one wanting a hot chick to try seducing my new boyfriend.&#x201d; He extended his hand. &#x201c;Jesse Aanes.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d heard of him. A half-demon PI out of Seattle who&#x2019;d worked with Lucas a few times. Lucas said he was a good guy, which was the only seal of approval I needed.</p><p>&#x201c;What brings you to Portland?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Cases. One that I&#x2019;m working now and a new one I wanted to run past Lucas. Two birds, one stone. I left him a message, but he hasn&#x2019;t returned it, which isn&#x2019;t like him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s on vacation with Paige. I confiscated their cell phones and the only messages I&#x2019;m passing on are well wishes and death notices.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed. &#x201c;Good idea.

He was a world-traveler, a student, a teacher, a soldier, an actor, a son, a brother, and a complex, intensely private man who kept his personal life a secret. In <em>Thornton Wilder: A Life</em>, author Penelope Niven pulls back the curtain to present a fascinating, three-dimensional portrait one of America's greatest playwrights, novelists, and literary icons.</p></p><p><p><em>Art is confession; art is the secret told. . . . But art is not only the desire to tell one's secret; it is the desire to tell it and hide it at the same time. And the secret is nothing more than the whole drama of the inner life.</em><br>&#x2014;Thornton Wilder</p><p><em>Thornton Wilder: A Life</em>, the first biography of the playwright and novelist since 1983, is also the first to be based on thousands of pages of letters, journals, manuscripts, and other documentary evidence of Wilder's life, work, and times. For more than a decade, biographer Penelope Niven has worked with unprecedented access to Wilder's papers, including his family's private journals and records, searching for the secrets that illuminate Wilder's public life and work, as well as the hidden inner self sometimes concealed and sometimes revealed in his art and in his papers.</p><p>Thornton Wilder was a multifaceted man: a teacher, novelist, playwright, lecturer, actor, musician, soldier, man of letters, outspoken citizen, and international public figure. He was also an enigmatic, intensely private man. He belonged to a close-knit, complicated family&#x2014;two brilliant parents, four gifted siblings, and the specter of his twin brother lost at birth. His biography is also a compelling family saga, starring Thornton Wilder, with strong supporting roles played by his father, mother, brother, and sisters.</p><p>He was a gypsy, wandering the world, writing, he said, for and about everybody&#x2014;a fact international audiences still embrace. <em>The Bridge of San Luis Rey</em>, <em>The Eighth Day</em>, and his other novels are still read in the United States and abroad. His plays, especially the iconic Our Town and the revolutionary <em>Skin of Our Teeth</em>, are still performed on stages around the globe.</p><p>Yet despite the international fame and visibility of Wilder the writer, far too little has been known or understood about Wilder the man&#x2014;until now. Comprehensively researched and richly detailed, <em>Thornton Wilder: A Life</em> brings the private man center stage and sheds new light on his published and unpublished work.</p><p>Penelope Niven is the author of critically acclaimed biographies of poet Carl Sandburg and photographer Edward Steichen, as well as <em>Swimming Lessons</em>, a memoir, and <em>Voices and Silences</em>, coauthored with the actor James Earl Jones. She is the recipient of three fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Thornton Wilder Visiting Fellowship at the Beinecke Library at Yale, and other fellowships and awards. </p></p><h2>Plastic Canvas for All Seasons</h2><p>Add a little holiday cheer to your home throughout the year when you stitch up these darling plastic canvas designs.

During the 4 years from February 2011,until the summer of 2015, I went through a fast and deep development with many realizations; both spiritually, energetically, religiously and professionally. The main realizations were the following; � The hands are highly spiritual organs. They can, when the fingertips meet the blood, as in pulse diagnosis, be transformed to highways into the spiritual world, and serve as organs of initiation. � The pulse-diagnosis is not a technique, it is a state of consciousness. � The changes in the pulse are not happening in the physical world, but in the spiritual. � To be able to detect pulse changes we have to be in the spiritual world. � To enter the spiritual world we have to separate either our thinking/feeling/willing or the elements of the physical world as height/width/depth/time. � Working with pulse-diagnosis is a way of initiation into the spiritual world. � Most diseases (80%) in children and animals are projections from the &#x201c;grown-ups&#x201d;, the parents. � The projections are real pathological entities, real pathological information, real &#x201c;demons&#x201d;. � All symptoms (diseases) are &#x201c;pathological&#x201d; information, and such information is not lost easily (no information is ever lost). � When we treat the excess after ordinary methods (the theory of the 5-star elemental Chinese theory) we just translocate the disease, the &#x201c;excessive pathological information&#x201d;, which is mostly of Yang (astral) nature. � When we treat the deficiency after the control theory of the 5-star elemental Chinese theory (as lectured by me before) we often just translocate the disease, the &#x201c;deficient pathological information&#x201d;, which is mostly of Yin (etheric) nature. � If we treat the middle, the equilibrium, the mid-point between excess-Yang-astral and deficiency-Yin-etheric, we will not translocate the disease, but dissolve it. � The so-called pathological structure is a living entity, which in old times was called a demon. o The Yin structures were called Ahrimanic demons. o The Yang structures were called Luziferic demons. � The 5-element star system of Chinese medicine is just a construct relating to the treatment of excess and deficiency, and do not function well in finding and treating the midpoint, and therefore must be revised. � The 6-star system is better to treat and find the midpoint. � The mid-point is related to the Christ-consciousness, and may be found by ways of; o Pulse; the Christ energy, where it is felt. o Pulse, the controller of the deficiency relating to the 5-star (father of the father of the symptoms) o Pulse; the midpoint of the triangle, the trinity. o Anatomically; the bodily midpoint between excess (Luzifer) and deficiency (Ahriman). o Cranio-sacrally; the midpoint at the head between excess (Luzifer) and deficiency (Ahriman). Thus, in the summer of 2015 I understood that my book on alternative medicine needed an update, a revision. All the above mentioned understandings had dawned on my mind and spirit. I felt that I had so much new to tell the world. I realized how much work it would take to update my 750 pages book, and did not look forward to that immense work. The inspiration to write a new book came to me on awakening on the 3rd of September 2015, 5 o'clock in the morning in Germany, after travelling to the old mystery places in Ireland and meeting a spiritual person that freed me from old thoughts. I suddenly understood that it was better to write a new book on spiritual medicine, rather than update the old one. I am happy here to be able to present the result of that inspiration.</p><p></p><h2>The Mystical Body: A Reflective Investigation of Supernatural and Spiritual Phenomena</h2><p>An expert on saints and mystics, Patricia Treece brings years of research to this compelling narrative on the dynamics of the mystical body.

Brilliantly illustrated.</p><p></p><h2>Inventing Tomorrow: H. G. Wells and the Twentieth Century</h2><p>H. G. Wells played a central role in defining the intellectual, political, and literary character of the twentieth century. A prolific literary innovator, he coined such concepts as &#x201c;time machine,&#x201d; &#x201c;war of the worlds,&#x201d; and &#x201c;atomic bomb,&#x201d; exerting vast influence on popular ideas of time and futurity, progress and decline, and humanity&#x2019;s place in the universe. Wells was a public intellectual with a worldwide readership. He met with world leaders, including Roosevelt, Lenin, Stalin, and Churchill, and his books were international best-sellers. Yet critics and scholars have largely forgotten his accomplishments or relegated them to genre fiction, overlooking their breadth and diversity.<br><br>In <i>Inventing Tomorrow</i>, Sarah Cole provides a definitive account of Wells&#x2019;s work and ideas. She contends that Wells casts new light on modernism and its values: on topics from warfare to science to time, his work resonates both thematically and aesthetically with some of the most ambitious modernists. At the same time, unlike many modernists, Wells believed that literature had a pressing place in public life, and his works reached a wide range of readers. While recognizing Wells&#x2019;s limitations, Cole offers a new account of his distinctive style as well as his interventions into social and political thought. She illuminates how Wells embodies twentieth-century literature at its most expansive and engaged. An ambitious rethinking of Wells as both writer and thinker, <i>Inventing Tomorrow</i> suggests that he offers a timely model for literature&#x2019;s moral responsibility to imagine a better global future.</p><p>Sarah Cole is Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature and dean of humanities at Columbia University. She is the author of <i>Modernism, Male Friendship, and the First World War</i> (2003) and <i>At the Violet Hour: Modernism and Violence in England and Ireland</i> (2012).Sarah Cole transforms our view of H. G. Wells, not only seeing him as a pivotal figure in his own world but also, with subtlety and conviction, connecting him with his modernist contemporaries. Wells emerges in this detailed, cogent, and incisive study as a complex and fascinating thinker filled with contradictions, combining moral force with artistic restlessness. He was headstrong, engaged, combative, innovative, industrious, fearless, and prophetic. <i>Inventing Tomorrow </i>does justice to his vast range of work while emphasizing how Wells must be placed at the core of any consideration of intellectual life in the early twentieth century. (Colm T�ib�n, author of <i>Brooklyn: A Novel</i>)<br><br>What if modernism met up with antimodernism, like matter and antimatter? In Sarah Cole&#x2019;s fascinating and ambitious new study, she argues that H. G. Wells&#x2019;s work was at once modernist and itself a critique of modernism, an explosive mix whose significance was missed both by his contemporaries and by literary critics who have taken his rivals at their word and mistaken their jealousy at his popularity for judgment of his merit. (Jill Lepore, author of <i>These Truths: A History of the United States</i>)<br><br>From the prehistoric to the posthuman, from the microcosmic to the cosmic, Wells wrote about everything under the twentieth-century sun. To see why he was the indispensable writer of the last century, we need a guide as skilled and authoritative as Sarah Cole, who gives to readers an eloquent vindication of modernism&#x2019;s forgotten man. (Jed Esty, author of <i>Unseasonable Youth: Modernism, Colonialism, and the Fiction of Development</i>)<br><br>Sarah Cole restores a colossus to size, recovering the enormous importance of H. G. Wells in the literary and cultural history of a century that seems, until now, to have left him behind. No longer. Written with synoptic power and narrative flair, synthesizing an extensive archive of print and film, <i>Inventing Tomorrow</i> splendidly establishes Wells not just as a figure of primary importance, but as an attractive, indeed fascinating, imaginative personality. (Vincent Sherry, Howard Nemerov Professor in the Humanities, Washington University in St. Louis)<br><br>Full of illuminating argument, fresh perception, and lively polemic,<i> Inventing Tomorrow</i><i> </i>makes an overwhelming case for the twenty-first century rediscovery of H. G. Wells. (Patrick Parrinder, University of Reading)<br><br>Sarah Cole&#x2019;s fascinating literary investigation <i>Inventing Tomorrow</i> shows how H. G. Wells&#x2019;s work is relevant and meaningful today. . . . The book&#x2019;s scholarship combines literary criticism with biographical elements, explaining how Wells mixed details of his own life and his modernist philosophy into his work.

The smallest fighting ships of the Royal Navy, these torpedo boats could fight in the shallowest waters, penetrate minefields, and hide in the inlets of enemy-held islands. From 1940 to 1943 they were the only surface craft continually able to seek out and attack Axis forces. Filled with action backed by telling details, the book describes night assaults on enemy convoys, clandestine operations, and Special Boat Squadron missions in North Africa and Yugoslavia. It is based on the eyewitness accounts of the officers and men who served in these perilous actions. Author Dudley Pope also looks at the question of why both the Allies and Axis forces fought so hard for what were mostly just large expanses of sand and water. Pope's vivid writing style, reminiscent of his popular novels, will appeal to general readers as well as students of World War II naval actions.</p></p><p>Dudley Pope is a veteran of World War II, having served as a cadet in the merchant navy until wounded in the Battle of the Atlantic. He is the author of numerous works of nonfiction, including the bestselling <i>Life in Nelson's Navy</i>, and eighteen Ramage novels.</p>
